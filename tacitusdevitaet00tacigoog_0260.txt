exception oi the apple, the German names ior imita, such as plume,
cherries, and pears, are borrowed from the Latin, none oi these being
successfully cultivated in Gerrnany until centuries later. pecorum:
probably the domestic animale, exclusive oi cais and dogs.

1¹7. plemmque: ¹frequently. This weakened senscoi the word is
much the more common in Tacitus, improcera: sc. pecora rant,
. a remarkable ellipsis but legitimate, in that terra could not he under-
stood with this word. Cp. also note ch. 3, 18. mmeritis: here
more particularly cattle, as shown by picria frontis. Caes. B. G. IV.
2, 2, speaking generally oi the native beasts oi burden (iumenta),
styles them proca and informia, but says they possessed great endur-
ance, being accustomed to hard labor daily.

18. suus honor: their pacatior beautp, such as Tacitus was accus-

tomed to see in Italian kine. Cp. also Verg. Georp. ΙΙΙ, 51. gloria .

frontis: apoetic expression forming the close oi a hexameter, here
added by way oi closer defiuition. See Introit. p. lxxi. Fine horna are
usually lacking to German cattle to this day. gaudent: sc.
Germani.

19. solae: for land was held in common (ch. 26), and silver and
gold were not found in any appreciahle quantities. The statement is
confirmed by the old Teutonic words (scilic, secli), signifying both
cattle and wealth. In Gothic, AugleSaxou, and Old Norse, the latter
had become the only meaning, and secli significantly heads the Runic
alphabet. Cp. the analogous development oi Latin pertremendum, ’
pecunia, Germ. Viek, and llngl. see, showing that originally cattle
were the only medium oi exchange or barter. gratissimae: hipltlp
pratispiap, notite occat pratrypinp, which would be incompatible with
soloe. With the statement, cp. also Caes. B. G. VI. 35, 6, mcpno
pecoris numero, craias aunt cupidissimi barbari, potiuntur. Argen-
tum et aurum ι sor os reparcis, etc, explanatory oi solae, the par-
ticles (here acm or enim) being omitted, as often when the important
word is emphasized by its position at the beginning. See note Apa
ch. 2, 5. With this sentiment, a commonplace both in classical and
modern literature, cp. eg. Ovid, Met. Ι. 140, effodiuntur opes, iari-
tcmeatc titulorum ‚² Hor. Germ. ΙΙΙ. 3, 49, ararum inrepertum etsie
melias sitam cam terro celat.

20. Nec tamen, etc: only apparently contradicts solae . . . opes,
theimplication being that even ii these metals did occur, they were
too rare to constitute opes. As a matter oi iaci, when Tacitus wrote
the Atracis, he had heard oi the existence oi unproductive mines in
