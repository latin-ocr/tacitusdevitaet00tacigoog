xiv mruonucrrer. 11.

orate speeehes (ch. 30-32, 33-34) are said to be out of
place in a biography.

The Relevancy of ch. aa-As regards the first of these
objections, it may be admitted that a modern writer would

in all probability have relegated the item to a leot-note, if ¹

he had thought it worthy of mention at all, but this device
was unknown to the ancients, who were compelled tc insert ἵ
such passages in the body cf the text. The episode is, l

however, by no means as irrelevant as it might seem at ’
first sight, for it admirably shows of what heterogeneous t
and unruly elements the army of Agricola was eomposed, ³

thus enhaneing the merit of a general capable of fusing χ

thern into an effective instrument of war, a fact subse-
quently emphasized by implicatiou, in that the decisive
battle was won wholly by the Roman auxiliaries‚ of whom
the Usipi had constituted a part. Again, if the adventure
was thought by Tacitus too noteworthy and interesting to
be omitted, it could have found uo other place without
destroying the chronological sequence of events, which
is rigidly adhered tc throughout. Finally, the passage
subserves a circinatio purpose. The author had been mar-
shaling all his facts to lead up to the denouement. With
the closing words of ch. 27, 3, atque r'tu r‘rrrttotr's utrimque
animia discessum, the no less excited reader feels the op
pressive calm that precedes the storm, feels that the final
crisis is at hand, and just as often in the Greek drama a
scothing choral ehant precedes the catastrophe, so Tacitus
has here introduced the magnum uc memorabile fucinus by
way of diversion, before he proceeds in the next chapter tc
the detailed story ei the final struggle, destined to prove so

alter his retirement, and, therefore, Tacitus passed over the former
briefly, while the latter are dealt with at some length. The same

method is favored by Menander, IX. 216(111. 369), τὰ μὴ ἀναγκαῖα
λυσιτελεῖ παρατρέχειν.
