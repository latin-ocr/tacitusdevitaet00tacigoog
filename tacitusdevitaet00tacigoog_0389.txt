[Illy. Books l„ XXI.. and XXII. 1

With Introduction and Notes by Professor J. H. westcott, Princeton
University. 12m0,cloth‚42f> pages. Price‚31.25.

N attempt has been made ln this volume to present in simple
and convenient form the assistance needed by young stu-
dents making their first acquaintance with Livy.

The editor's experience in the class-room has led him to anno-
tate the text copiously. On the other hand, that fulness of illus-
tration which apparently aims to supersede the function of the
teacher has been carefully avoided.

Professor James Η, Dillard, Tulane Universify‚ New Orkans, La.: l
should like to say that Westcort's Livy is the most satisfactory text-book
that l lrnow of. Other works may put on a greater show of learning;
but when one comesto everyday class-room use, the editing of this text
is found to be exceptionally satisfactory.

Professor charles Ε. Bennett, Cornell Universuy‚ Ithaca, N. l'. .· lt seems
to me an excellent boolr. The notes are exceedingly fresh and scholarly:
they call attention to the right things in the right way. This edition is
superior to any similar edition with which l arn acquainted.
