1⁷. adfirmavit: coatrmed ; ior that Britain is an island had been
asserted by Pytheas and others, but Agricola's fieet first demonstrated
it. It is to this achievement that the only ancient author, besides
Tacitus, who mentions Agricola, reiers. cp. Dio Cass. LXVI. 20.

18. Orcadas: ie. the Orkneys. That they were wholly unknown
up to this time, as Tacitus states, is disproved by Mela and Pliny. -·
The Greek 0000001100 plural occurs in Tacitus but rarely and only in
proper names. Cp. (lerna. 45; Hist. IV. tt ;' Aac. 111.61; IV. 513
XII. 32, 33, 38; XIV. 29.

19. Dispecta: was deserted ta tlte distance ,· but,un1ike the Ork-
neys,'Tbule was not subdued, because they had no orders to do so,
and even 11 they had, the approaching winter would have made it
inexpedient to attempt its subjugation, the tacit assumption being that
the Romans would have had no difficulty in accomplishing the 10010.-
The verb at the beginning, and attha same time in juxtaposition with
domuit, skilliully emphasizes the antithesis. Thule: first mentioned
by the distinguished navigator, Pytheos 01 Massilia (4111 0001. aa),
and regarded by the ancients generally as the most northeriy point 01
the earth, hence ultima Thale (Verg. (leoco. I. 30). 11 was said by
Pytheas to be six days’ sail from Britain, the night and day being six

knowledge 01 these regions had been but little advanced in the four
centuries that separate Tacitus from Pytheas. -00 the brachylogy in

elliptical comparison common with perinde, aeque, and the like. This
