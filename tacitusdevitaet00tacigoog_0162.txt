runt r] noras enarrarre. 79

context provee, auctor is here used without the accessory meaning of
trustworthiness, a signification, though extremely common in post·
Augustan Latin, still foreign to earlier writers. oblongae scutulae:
the exact shape of the dish called scutrda is unknown. lt may have
been rectangular or more like a trapezoid or trapezium. Oblooyac
seems to indicate an elongation of two of its sides, which in a rough
way miglrtcorrespondto the configuration of Great Britain. bipenni:
the center of the double battle-ax, representing the narrowest part of
the island. As ccl, in place of cut, seems to show, there cannot have
been any essential differcnce inform between the scutula and the
bipennis. But such comparisons must not, in any case, bc too closely
pressed, based as they were upon very vague and untrustworthy in-
formation. '

12. adsimulaverc: aplural predicate after two singular subJects
in adversative clauses Is one of the characteristic features of Tacitean
usage. Here the incongruity is all but done away with by the plural
apposition. So also eg. Ana. XII. 1, huic Pullus, illi Callistus son-
tores aderant. Bt: aad os a crerier of fact. This asseverative use
of et, at tha beginning of a sentence, is common in Tacitus. Cf. eg.
22, 213 Germ. 35, 14. citra=siac Seech. 1,12. unde: sc.
oriebatur. With unde (18 insinuem), and similarly with hinc, inde,
cs ec, and the like, Tacitus omits the verb. Iu the smaller works
again, Germ. 4, 7, unde habitus; 9, 29, aride causo.

13. ln universum fama: ie. the erroneous notion gained general “

, acceptance that the entire island, including Caledonia, had the shapc
spoken oi. transgressis: this dative oi local standpoint, akiu to
the Greek dative absolute, is first found in Varro L. L. V. 57. Cp.
notech.11, 10. inmensum. . . spatium: the phrase occurs in
five other places in Tacitus. Under the influence oi Vergil he de-
velops an increasing fondness for inmensus, iordanis, ingens, using
them generally in the sense of proprius. enorme: here shopclem,
but usually synonymous with increatas, eg. ch. 36, 3.

14. litore. . . tenuatur: a dactylio hexameter. Verses in prose,
whether complete cr partial, are severely censured by the ancients.
Cp. eg. Cic. Orci. 20, 67 and Quint. IX. 4, 7, and but few genuine
instaures occur, the rhythmical cadence being in the majority of cases
not felt, if the sentence is properly read. The present line, how-
ever, Aaa. 1. 1, though faulty, and especially Germ. 39, 13, angrariis·
...sacrorn are noteworthy -On the conciseness of expression, cp.
Iatrod. p. xxxiii.
