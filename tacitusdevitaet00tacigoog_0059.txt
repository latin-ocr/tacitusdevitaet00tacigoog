tion, and if it be further obser-ved that Tacitus was in every
instance in possession of fuller and more reliable knowl-
edge than was vouchsafed to Cacsar, we cannot but reject

the assumption of catenatae indebtedness, and must conclude
that the Ocnnnenlcn'es, though certainly documents of prirne
importance‚ cannot, in the eyes of Tacitus, writing as he
did more than a century later, have had anything more than
an historical interest and velue.

Two other works, also still extant, have without misgir-
ings or qualifications been likewise put down among the
certain sources of the Germanic, namely, the Clroroyrcplrio
of one Pomponius Melo (c. 50 an.) and the socelled Natural
History of the elder Pliny, numerous alleged resemblances,
both in contente and phraseology, having been adduced in
support of this view. But this inference is vitiated at

¹ the very outset by the nonobservance of a methodica]

canon in investigatione of this nature, which, though gen-
erally ignored, is essential if our conclusions are to rest on

· a firm foundation. It may be briefly formulated by saying

that mere similitude, though apparently never so striking,
does notin itself afford any reliable clew to indebtednese,

provided there exist side by side equally noteworthy diver· ¹
pancos or contradictione· even where this is not the case,
the possibility must always be taken into consideration that
such parallelisrns are due.either to a common third source
or conditioned by the similarity of the subjectmatter.

Now, ii we apply this cardinal principle to the two
authors in question, it will be found that the hitherto uni-
versally accepted conclusion that Tacitus was directly in-
debted to them is unwarranted by the facts.

Pomponius Mela-In the reign of Claudius, one Pone
penius Melo composed a compendious geography of the
world (sitne orbis) in three books. The author tells uc,
in his Preface, that the subject does not lend itself
