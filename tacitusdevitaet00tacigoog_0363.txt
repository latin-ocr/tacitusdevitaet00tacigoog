16. solutum ι 10. the cars were 1101 fixed in oar-locks, but could
be shifted as occasion demanded. quibusdam fluminum = q. flu-
minibus. So eg. Diui. 21, ib, q. antiquorum ,· Agr. 37, 29, bostium
. . . quidm, and very frequently in the larger works. Cp. also note
ch. 43, l.

17. bino vel illino remigium: they roco nou oa ibis, now on 11101
side.

13, 01 opibus honos: even ueniri is in reputo ameno them, in con-
tradistinction 10 the indifference attributed 10 the Germane generally,
incb. b, 22. eoqueunus imperitat : some such theory 01 the origin
oi monarchical institutione seems to be implied in Lucret. V. 1114 n,
quod (sc. divitiae) facile 01 validis et pulchris 11010ρεί1 bonorem ; Diui-
tioris enim sectam plerumque secuntur Quomlubet et sortes et pulchro
corpore creti. nullis lam exceptionibus: nc lonycr witb any re·
0111011000, such as limited 1110 sovercign or princeps in other German
communities. cp. ch. 7, 30; ll, 13 11, and above, l. 8.

19. non precario iure parendi: 10111 a riybt to exuet obediencs
not based on sufferancc, the genitive 01 1110 substantival gerund being
equivalent 10 a Greek articular infinitiva (τοῦ πείθεσθαι). Precarr'us is
011011 used 01 something contingent and transitory‚ as opposed 10 what
is inalienable and permanent. cp. Hist. 101, precarium seni impc-
11001 et breui transiturum. The witnesses upon which Tacitus'
account is ultimately based probably became acquainted with the
Suiones at their great religione festival, which occurred every nine years,
and, as the king was also the chief priest, they may easily have carried
away au exaggerated impression 01 his absolute power.

20. 111 promiscuo: tn eucrybody's 110οᾶ0. clause: i.e. during
the peace which prevailed at religious festivals. Cp. ch. 40, 10 1.
Tacitus’ sources probably mistook this 1001101 the regular custom,
and he was thence misled into thinking that it was a despot’s device
10 prevent revolution.

21. etquidem servo: andoaldus at 1101. This isexplained by
enimuero, etc, below, the intervening quio clause giving two reasons
101 ormo . . . clauso, the first account-ing ior 1110 needlcssness 01 arms,
the second lor their undcnrabiluy. ¹

22. manus: 1100110,οε in ch. 31, 2. tactis hsciviunt: and
are hence rendered incapable 01 0110011101 opposition. On the enervat-
ing effect 01 peace, see note ch. 14, 24.

23. usqne .. . neque. . . ne .. . quidem: this polysyndeton
is especially common in Tacitus, and in a descending climax, as here.
