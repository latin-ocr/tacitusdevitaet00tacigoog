alrannus curaremus or run AGRIOOLA. xvii

The Historical Rataspem-5. Σύγκρισις. Immediately
upon the account of the ethnology aud geography of Britain
there follows in our treatise a fairly detailed retrospect
oonoerning the predecessors of Agricola (ch. 13-18), audit,
too, has been pronounced out of place in a biography. But

’ this objection is also unwarranted, for here again Tacitus

strictly conforme to the rules for the βασιλικὸς λόγος, the
· historioal surrey being clearly in the nature of a σύγκρισις
or comparison, which is invariably given as an integral
part of the biographioal encomium.¹ And that Tacitus him·
seli regarded these and the preceding chapters as legitimate
and essential is indicated by ch. 18, 17, banc Britannice
statam, bos bellorum vices Agricola . . . incenit, with which
words he. introduces the πράξεις ἐν πολέμῳ of his hero.

The σύγκρισις is preferably made to follow the πράξεις and
is placed immediately· before the ἐπίλογος,2 but its position
was not definitely fixed³ aud Tacitus was therefore perfectly

at liberty to insert it where he chose, without violating
any rhetorical standards. With that keen eye for effec-
tive dramatis grouping which distinguishes him above all

among ancient historiens took the greatest pains in regard to tha
topography and strategio monuments of a battle, do not wholly satisfy
modern standards of accuracy aud alamuosa, for they, too, occasionally
succumbed to the temptation of rhetorical embellishment.
