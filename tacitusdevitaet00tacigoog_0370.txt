Caes. B. 62. VI. 24, 4. On omnium as opposed to proceram, elsewhere
to principes, 'see note ch. 11, 31.

5. torpor procerum: this is also according to Tacitus a conspicu-
ous traitoi the German nobility. Cp. 14, 24; 15, 7 n. 3 22, 27 ; 45, 11.
Connbfls . . . laedantur: byintcmtarm'aycs 1111111111 some 11
1111 acquirat tlte homely appearance os 111 8111111111. This fact is
given as the only feature that might possibly militate against the as-
sumption oi the Germanic character 11 the Peucini, in view of what
the author had asserted in ch. 4, 51.

6. multum ex moribus truerunt: 11. not only the Venedi,
like the Peucini, lost the handsome appearance oi Germane through the
same cause, but they also contracted many oi the habits of the Sar-
matae. The chief of these is stated in the nam clause, namely, their
1111 oi plunder. This Sarmatian trait—ior with other German tribes
it was not habitual (cp. note ch. 14, l) —is again pointed out, Hist.
1. 79, praedae magis quam pugnae 1111111 ι . . cupt'dine praedae.

8. erigitur: 11111, the passive being, as oiten in 'Tacitus used asa
middle. Oi rising ground, eg. cb. 27, 29 ; Verg. Aca. VIII. 416, ia·
aula . . . 11111111· Hist. V. 6, praecipuam acontium Libanum erigit
(sc. Iudaea). Although Ptolemaeus also speaks oi Οὐενεδικὰ ὅρη,
there are no mountains oi any sine in these regions, nor does Tacitus
state tute positively, as quidquid implies. Hi: 11. Venedi.

9. potius retenentur: se. qaam inter Sarmatas. domos
figunt: with the expression, cp. Ama XIII. 54, iamque fiae-rant danaos.

10. scuta gestant: cp. Hist. 1. 79, nequeenim acuto defendi ntae

ramperm'citctc.

11. Sarmatiae: apud Sarmatas. Cp. ch. 45, 14, barbaris. The
usual interpretation, which takes this as a shortened comparison (1111-
paratt'o conpendiaria) ior Sarmatarum moribus, is incompatible with
niventibus. in plaustro: 1111111111111111111111111. ThIs
mode of liic is otten ascribed to the ScythIans, a race closely related
to, ii not identIcal vvith, the Sarmaticus. Cp. Pindar, fragne. 72 (82),
eminatam olr0v3 Herod. IV. 46 3 Hor, Oarm. 111. 24, 10, plaustra
onaan m'te trabant domoc,· Amm. Marc. XXII. 8, 42. It led to the
invention oi a tribe, styled ’1111111111 See Mela, 11. 2. Observa that
the author gives no diversitas, corresponding to 11111 gestant, because,
unlilre the other two features, the simple negation naturally suggested
itselt in this cese.
