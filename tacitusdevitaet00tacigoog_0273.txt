ohapter 9, 26. Deorum maxime Mercurium colunt: so
exactly Caes. B. G. VI. ll, i, deuna ntauime Mercurium colunt. The
attributes enumerated byhin1,l.c., hurrooauu'uru inuentorem artium
serrant, huuc ciarum atque itinerum eluceat, buac acl quaestus pecuniae
mercaturasque babere uim mariarum arbitrantur, correspond tc those
of ll'odaa (Odin). The petasus oi Hermes-Mercury had its counter-
part in Wodan's broad-brimmed hat, the caduceus in his staff3 both
act as chthcnic deities and are the gods ol cultural progress par excel-
lence. Engl. Wednesday (=Woaaasaay) and the French. Mercredi
( :Mercurii (lies) imply the same identification, which is perhaps due
to Posidonius. lt was still accepted as late as the8th century. The
worship oi Wodan‚ as the supreme deity, was, however, not pan-Ger-
inanie,atleastn0t atthistime, nordoes Tacitus, as is generally supposed,
really mean this, as Deorum uterinae for deerat maximum shows ; but
lt was probably more strictly true oi the Istaevones, or lower Rhenish
tribes, lor when Tacitus (Hist. lV. 65), in a fictitious speech, makes

pretation fitted days would imply a ιοο accurate state of the Germanic
calendar, although the phrase is repeatcdly sc used in ritual and legal
phraseology.

27. humanis . . . boetlls: human sacrifices are characteristic ol
all primitive rituale, the substitution cf animale being invariably a
sign ci cultural progress, although sporadic instances continue to
occur in later historical times. Cp. Plut. Thera. 13, and Quaeri. Itone.
83 (during the Second Punic War). That this practice was not exclu-
sively confined ιο the Wodan cult is clear from Tacitus hirnsell. Cp.
ch. 39, 15; 40, 15, and Aua. XIII. 57, where the custom ol sacrificing
the defeated foe, Marti ac Mercurio, is ascribed ιο the Hermunduri
and Chatti. Herculem: cp. note ch. 3, ll.

28. Martem: naturally identified by the interpretatio Romana
(ch. 43, 25) with the Germanic god oi war, Tiu or Ztu. Cp. Engl.
