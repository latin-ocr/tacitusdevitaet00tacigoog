Rome could not but have proved averitable blessiug, though
they were too blind to recognize this3 the other paints the
Chauci in roseate colors, and styles them populus inter Ger·
coortos nobilissimus. The strong tendency of Tacitus to
idealize will not in this instance satisfactorily account for
this notevvorthy divergence, for the &rorici were a tribe well
known to the Romans, and Pliny's description is probably
that of an eye-witness. If, therefore, the Natural History
was consulted by Tacitus, as we are assured, it is hard to
understand why he, with such trustworthy information
before him, deliberately discarded this authority in a mat

misrepresentation.

But if this encyclopaedia must, therefore, be eliminated
from the probable sources of Tacitus, the same writer's
Bello (ierarchiae, in no fewer than twenty books, may be
with some confidence classed among the works consulted.

wrote a continuation, has wholly perished, so that the
