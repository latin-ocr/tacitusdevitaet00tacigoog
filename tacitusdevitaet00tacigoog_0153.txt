such rivalry, for a good wife fullills her one supreme mission in life
by being such, whereas a man's sphere 01 noble achievement is not
restricted to the home circle. Tacitus doubtless intended this as a
gallant compliment to his mother-in-law, who may well have still been
living when this bicgraphy was published.

18. Salvium Titianum: L. Salvius Otto Titianus, brother of
Otho, the future emperor, was consul in 52 and again in 69, proconsul
in esset. After the death oi Otho, he was pardoned pietate et ipnooic
(Hist. 11. 60).

19. dedit: so. ei. The ellipsis 01 the demonstrative proncun is
particularly common inTaeitus. Introd. p. xxxi. neutro=aentra

re. So Ann.IIl. 11100110. A usage especially frequent in post
Augustan Latin. See Dici. 19, 8, ominbus.

20. parata peccantibus: a province was often regarded as a
legitimate field for extortion and personal aggrandizement. To have
resisted so strong a temptation wne, therefore, a special proci of Agric-
ola's integrity. The praise here accorded to Agricola ie, however,
sornewliat inconsistent with oh. 9, 17 f.-Esset must b'e supplied after
paratu. On this ellipsis, see Introd. p. xxxii. proconsul . . . mali:
Tacitus has here, in order to emphasize the honesty of his herc, been
guilty of a slight suppressio oevi, ior Agricola served the greater part
01 his quaestorship under L. Antistius Vetas, proconsul 01 Asia for
osset, alofty character, as appears from Tacitus himself, in Ana.
XVI. 101.

22. mutuam dissimulationem mali: the proconsul was willing
10 connive at any rascality on the part 01 his subordinate, provided
the latter would, in turn, promise to be blind to his misdeeds
auctus est: i.e. his family was increased hy the birth of a daughter.
'The word is used in this sense by Cic. cd Att. Ι. 2, l, and again by
Tae 11001184. This daughter subsequently became the wiis 01

23, ln subsidium simul et solacium: eleusinium, because of the
reasons given in note tol. tlt-On the alliteration, see Introd. p.
xxviii. and on the position elstanni, cp. Introd. p. xxviii.

24. inter quaesturam, etc: ie. anitum interponentem, etc,
the incongruity being due 10 the author’s desire to avoid the awkward
repetition of anatis. It seems that in the regular cursus honoram
an interval 01 cne year was required between each oi the offioes here
mentioned. The tribuneship of Agricola would, therefore, fall in the
year 66 and the praetorship in 68, the year of Nero’s death.
