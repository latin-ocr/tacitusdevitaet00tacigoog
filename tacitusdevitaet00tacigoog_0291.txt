times in the Dialogus, and is always postpositive, except Dici. 36, 18,
adoubtful passage. sudore . . . sanguine: by tlte emeat os oae's
brom . . . bloodslted. Alliterative antithesis—these particular terms
being frequently combined—is more common in Tacitus than in any

. other writer. cp. Iatrod. Ape. p. xxviii. On the epigrammatic close

01 the chapter, cp. Iatrod. p. lxiv.

Ohapter 15. 5. bella non ineunt: with special reference to
the comitatae, although possibly not exclusive 01 the better classes
generally. multum venatibus: this is confirmed by many pas-
sages. Cp. ch. 17, 8; 23, 14; 46, 14; Caes. 13. (1. IV. 1, 8, 01 the
Suebi, maltum 111111 ia certationibus‚· VI. 21, 3, cita ommis 111 vertati-
om'bms atem ta stadiis ret militaris 'coaststit (in times 01 peace);
. Pomp. Mela 111. 3, 28; Sen. de proc. 4, 14, ia alimentum seraa coptam
(sc. Germani). The Germanic mythology, moreover, and the national
epics also furnish superabundant evidence 01 this fondness 101 the
chase, and 10 this day the love 01 tantiae has remained an ethnologi·
cal characteristic 01 the Teutouic race.

6. plus per otium mansigunt: ie. whenever opportunities 101
1071111111101011000011011111111101, they gave themselves up to sloth-
fulness rather than 10 agriculture, trade, or other modes 01 labor.
dediti somno ciboque : cp. ch. 17, 5 ; 22, 27 ; and 101 the expression,
Sall. Oct. 2, 8, dediti centri atque comato. The passage emphasizes
the eontrast with the busy and active Roman. ,

7. Fortissimus . . .hebent: the entireclause virtually reiter-
ates, but more in detail, the thought just brought out. Such iulness
01 expression becomes increasingly rare in the later writings 01 Taci-
tus, Here 11 is still part 01 tho elevated tone so conspicuous in these
paragraphs. delegata . . . curaieminls: anablative absolute,
explanatory 01 the principal thought (here 1111117 apeme), is quite Taci-
1111111191.2,3.8;14,13;22,6;30,16;44,2. The fact here
stated is still true 01 the Frisians, and the custom obtains in many
parts 01 Germany 1ο this day. All this is, 01 course, 111 glaring contrast
with the liie 01 1 Roman lady.

9. tamilla: probably to be taken here in the restricted and less
usual meaning 01 the household 01 family, exclusive oi the slaves,
So eg. Plaut. Tria. 379, occasionally even in Cicero, and quite ire-
quently in Tacitus. ipsi: tlte masters, ie. those who were neither
senes nor infirmi. Cp. the phrase ipse dicit. hebent: toanpe
