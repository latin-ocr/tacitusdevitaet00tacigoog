last subject for whom this ancient honor was decreed, but he declined
it twice, in 19 and 14 so. After the tirno of Hadrian, its empty sub-
stitute was also done away with. inlustris statuae: the statuo tri·
omphalis, or laureato, as it is variously called, was since the time of
Augustus placed in the Forum. ,

22. quidquid: we should expect quidquid aliod, asin Dici. t, 1 ;
19, 1, multo verborum honore: the repetition of honore is pos·
sibly designed to convey the impression oi the emptiness and mean-
ingless character oi these alleged marks oi distinction.

23. addique: Domitian also suggested that the senate should
spread the information that, as an additional markos imperial favor,
Agricola’s appointment as governor of Syria was soon to follow.-
opiaioaeni shows that this intimation was not given in the decree
itself, for only an official and actual announcement could have prop

Atilius Besae mentioned in amilitary diploma oi the year 80 sn. as
the commender of a number oi oolrorts and cavalry squadrons in Pan-
nonia. maioribus: perhaps best taken in its regular sense of
older men, for the meaning more distinguished, generally given to the
word here, is not found elsewhere, although minores is repeatedly used
forisfactores But in either case, the term subserves the purpose of
showing that the appointment was in the nature oi a promotion, for
Syria, as well as Britain, was a Caesarian province, both being gov-

in the imperial household, and under bad emperors constituted not
infrequently the real power behind the throne. - Ministeriis = minis-

28. dabatur: a kind ol epistolary imperfect, regarded from the
point of view of the recipient.—The new appointment was to be
made known to Agricola only to insure a speedy acquiescenoe in the
recall which had been sent to him previously, Domitian fearing that
Agricola might not comply with it, but the general’s loyal conduct,
evinced by his immediate departure, rendered this stratagem un-
necessary.
