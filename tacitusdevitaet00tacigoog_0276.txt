matie close of the chapter is a favorite device oi Tacitus, but particu-
larly conspicuous in this treatise. Cp. Introd. p. lxiv.

Ohapter 10. 6. Auspicia sortisque: the generic term is defined
by the inore particular. Cp. Introd. p. lxviii. utqui maxime ob-
servant: observant ut t't' qui macinae observent. A common elliptical
expression, eg. Liv. V. 25, 9, but in Tacitus only here. The fact
itseli is abundantly confirmed. Cp. eg. Caes. B. d. Ι. ὅθ, 4; Amin.
Marc. XIV. 10, 9.

7. simplex: uniscunt, in contrast to the Romans, who had several
methods oi castiug lots. frugiferae arbori: probably the apple
tree and acorn-bearing trees such as the oak, and especially the beech
(cp. fingi. bools, Germ. buch). Later, however, also the willow was
used.

8. decisam: this is confirmed by the etymology of Engl. lot,
Germ. los, meaning something broken off. notis: this is the
earliest mention of rnnes, ior noto is a technical term ior a letter
in Latin. They numbered originally 16 ideograms and constituted a
kind oi hieratio alphabet. The Roman letters, which were doubtless
known to the Germans from an early time through coine, seem not to
have been in general use before the td century Ab.

9. candidam vestemr white was the prerequisite color in aii
reiigious ritual, as symbolical oi purity. Cp. Plato, de lep. ΧΠ. p.
956 Α. χρώματα δὲ λευκὰ πρέποντ’ ἂν θεοῖς εἴη (= cic. de lep. II. 18, 45).
temere ac fortuito: without order ovtd ot bnpltueord. This and
similar synonymic collocatione are very frequent. As here, eg. Cic.
Tusc. Ι. 49, 118; Orat. bb. 186; de off. Ι. 29, 103. spargunt:
poetical and post-Augustan for dispergunt, dissipant. Cp. Verg. Aen.
VI. 230, spargens . . . rome felicis oliuae, and note ch. 6, 10.

10. Mox: thereupon, subsequently. See note ch. 2, 15. si
publice consulitur: ty the uttspices ore to be taken iu o utatur os
public concern. Consulens is the coa proprio for augury. For the
indicative, where the subjunctive of repeated action would be rnore
usual, see eg. ch. ll, 14. sacerdos civitatis: probably the oldest
priest in the tribal community. Originally doubtless the ¹princeps
exercised the priestly function as well, as eg. in Hosneric society.
See also note ch. 43, 25.

11. pater familiae: this is the invariable form in Tacitus. Ι pre·
catus deos, etc: observo the different tenses oi the participles.
