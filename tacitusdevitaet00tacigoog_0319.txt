with Caes. Β. 0. IV. 1, 7, VI. imit, the only other extant treat
ment of the subject, is perhaps the most unsatisfactory in the entire
Germania. Nor can the trustworthiness oi the account be determined,
as there is an interval oi more than a century between Caesar and
Tacitus. On the other hand, the earliest post-Tacitean documenta on
German land tenure are as late aa the bth century, and they relate
to agricultural communitiee with permanent stodes, whereas the
Germana of Tacitus' time had not yet altogether emerged from their
primitive nomedic state; but the changes inland tenure incident to
that evolution must have been many and significant. What the author
meant to say, will nevertheless be found tolerably clear, if we emanci-
pata ourselves frorn the misleading information of arelatively modern
date. pro numero cultorum: the migrating‚ conquering tribes
occupied only so much of the acquired extensive domains aa could be
tilled or utilized; subsequently, definite allotrnents were parcelled out
in accordance with the rank of the several occupante. This phrase, of
course, implica a previous scale of distribution, which served aa a
criterion.

by Caesar, are strangely ignored by Tacitus. They would have ad-
mirably subserved his idealiziug tendency‚ for, aa the following shows,
he was not convinced that this change from tilled to fallow landa was
made to relieve the soil before exhaustion. The agricultural principle
of the rotation of crops seems, in fact, to belong to ahigher cirihzation.
Per carros, cartually. So eg. Aac. I. 8.

which, though 'requiring considerably more time, would, on the other
hand, yield more satisfactory and better developed products. .
