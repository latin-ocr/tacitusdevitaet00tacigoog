rici ce] voras. charran 45. 219

11. laborant: 1100 cultivate. As a transitive verb ior elaborare,
the verb is quite common iu poetry ; but in the sense called ior here,
it seems 001 10 occur elsewhere. et mare scrutantur: as mere
cannot mean secedere (cp. below, l. 13), the usual interpretation
which regards this clause as a general statement more closely defined
by the epexegetic ae, etc., is untenable. There is in all probability a
reference here to secl fisbetiea, 01 least Adamas Bremen (1111000-
tury) still says 01110 Aestii, pellibus abundant perecriais; aud Taci-
tus himself seeme 10 allude to the same occupatiori 10 ch. 17, 12, where
exterior 0000000 01 1000100οα00 designatas 11οΒ01110. The identi-
001 phrase occurs Agr, 30, 30.

12. ac = ac praeterea. So 01100. sollemnium: sc. Germa·
nortem. This statement flatly contradicts all that we know 01 110
provenance 01 umber, ior the Phoenicians brought it 01 0 very early
date from the shores 01 110 North 110· nor did Pytheas, cited by
Pliny in his elaborate account oi this substance (N. H. XXXVII. 2,
11, 31-11), have reference 10 any other regious; finally it was there
that the Romans became acquainted with it in the expedition 01
Drusus (12 0οη). Τ10 1001 1101 Tacitus speaks only 01 110 Βο1110
Aestii 101110 connection may imply that in his time 110 0011001100
01 amber 00 110 shores 01 110 North Sea had been wholly abandoned.
In any case, it disproves 110 universal assumption that his account is
based upon that 01 Pliny. See also below, and lotrad. p. liii. ipsi
glaesum vocant: this is a Teutonic word, the same 00 our 01000,Ι 110
Lettic languages,.to which the Aestian belonged, style it pectere,
00011000, 10101000 ,· 101 as Tacitus, misled by his authorities, regarded
the Aestii as Suebic Germane, he naturally took placeam to he their
word ior 00010010. Cp. also Ρ110. N. Η. l.c. 42, certem est . . . ab
Germanis adpellari placeam.

On the subjective dative, see note ch. 3, 30. quaesitum comper·
tumve: the former refers more particularly to nature, the latter 10
retia. cp. 001001. 2, 2. The following is one 01 110 extremely iew
passages 01 the (10000010 alluded 10 by later writers, ior Cassiodorus,
