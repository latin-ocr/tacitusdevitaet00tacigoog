82 nores. 0111111111 11. [risse

transierant. ut: ce titipht be expected. This elliptical use 01 at
occurs 011011 111 Tacitus, ag. 18,1 ; (ierne. 18, 1131 27, 273 30, 27;
45, 14.
2. Habitus corporum: physiccl characteristica So 11010148.
ex eo argumenta: sc. peteretne-On the ellipsiS, cp. Introd. p. xxxi.
³. rutilae . . . artus: cp. cerm. 4, 9, rutilae comae, macca cor·
pora. -Tacitus's information was probably derived from Agricola,
,though he may have seen some oi the nativas in Rome.
ι 4. Silurum: they dwelt in what is now South Wales and Mon-
mouthshire, and were subdued by Frontinus. See ch. 17, 14. Their
origin, probably Celtic (see below), is still an unsolved problem 01
ethnology. colorati: usually taken in the sense oi swarthp, sua-
111101, an epithet applied by the ancianis 10 the Hindoos, Chinesc, and
Etmscans3 but such a designation seems quite out 01 place with
respect to a nation living in northern elimes, and would be incon·
sistent with their Celtic origin, nor is there any evidence that the
Iberians 01 Spain were colorati ; finally, itis important to observe
that in the rest 01 the description oi the Silures unlilre that 01 the
Caledoniam, no phystccl, but only externa] and acquired characteris-
tics are referred 1ο. 11 will, therefore, be best to interpret the epithet
in aliha sense here, i.e. painted, possibly 10110001, which is a wall-
attested practice 01 the Britons. Cp. Caes. B. d. V. 14, 2.

5. et: et praeterea, aad the scot atorecoer. See note ch. 10, 19.
011 et aiter an asyndeton, sec Intrcd. p. xxviii.

6. easque sedes: the context leaves 11 undetermined whether
Tacitus meant 10 say that iberians settled in the territory then occu-
pied by the Silures, the latter acquiring iberian customs‚ in which
case the Silures were Celts (cp. the term Celtiberi), 01 whether the
Silures 01 his time ware the descendants 01 the iberian conquerors
who drove out the Celtic aborigines. In either case the hypothesis 01
the iberian migration must be rejected.

7. proximi Gallis et similes, eta: ie. the tribes dwelling nearest
10 the Gauls (viz. the Cantians) also (et = etiam) resemble them.
'l'he two sea clauses do not give alternative reasons, but the first is
in a measure the direct result oi the proximity, while the similar
climatic conditions account 101 the ethnological resemblance. du·
rante originis usu: because the castoras cs their original state were
retained. dirrare in tha sense 01 10 saraiae, seems 10 occur first in Livy.

8. diversa: ta opposite directions. For the meaning opposite, cp.
eg. ch. 23, 28. positio caeli: 01110010.
