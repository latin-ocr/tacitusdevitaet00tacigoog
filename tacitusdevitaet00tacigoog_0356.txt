allay any suspicion as to the probability oi one priest doing away with
a number oi slaves. Probably there were more than one present, but
the death penalty was apracautionary measure to prevent the fraud
which they practised upon the people from being divulged by the
semi, the sacrifice of human victims being, doubtlesa represented as
an essential part oi the ritual, as in the Herminonic ceremonial oi the
Semnones. Cp. cb. 39. The priests thus secured necessary help, and
at the same time were ires irom all suspicion oi foul play.

16. hinc: hence crisos. On the ellipsis, see note ch. il, 29.
ignorantie: the desire to secure an effective close has involved
Tacitus in a slight inconsistency, ior he had just said that the people
did not consider themselves in the dark, believing illud, etc, to be
numen ipsam. quid sit iilud: the indirect question depende upon
the verb implicd in ipnorantt‘a.

Chapter 41. 18. Et. . . quidem . . . (sed) propior: this,
ellipsis oi sed alter et . . . quidem is especially common in Tacitus.

19. quo modo. . . sic lor nt . . . ita (sio),is of frequent occur-
reuse in Tacitus, but it was here particularly used to avoid the repeti-
tion oi nt. paulo ante: viz. ch. 32 li.

20. Rhenum: sc. secutas sum, to be supplied ont ci sequar. On
this ellipsis, cp. note ch. 36, 21. Hermundurorum: ior their
locatim, see map. Originally they dwelt somewhat further north,
the Elbe separating them irom the Semnones. Aiter the Marcoma-
nic war (176 mn), they disappear from history, being assimilated by
the Thuringians. As the name seems to imply, they belong to the
Herminones (see ch. 2).

21. nonlnrlpa . . . sed: non(solnm) in ripa (scDannuii) . . .
sed (etiam). This ellipsis is, perhaps, more frequent in Tacitus than
in previous writers. The omissiones any mention oi the Raetian
limes, on which they in reality bordered, is probably due to the lact
that this part oi the frontier fortifications had not yet been finished
when the ‚Germania was written.

22. penitus: sor beyond, deep inland on the other side of the
river. etque etc. ι a concrete statement, added to delinethe vagus
expression penitus. Cp. Introd. p. lxviii. splendidissima . . .
colonia: Aspasia Vindelicorum, the modern Augsburg, founded by
Augustus about 12 an. Striotly speaking, it was a municipium, not a
colonio; but by the time oi Tacitus these terme were used promis·
cuously in the sense of oppidum or civitas. ¹
