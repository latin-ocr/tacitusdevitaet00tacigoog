11. nullo credente, eta: ie. no one helieving that tidings, ii
received with genuine sorrow, would be sought with such sager haste,
the implication being that Domitian knew the salise oi Agricola’s
illness, and desired to leam as quickly as possible whether the poison
had done its deadly work. Thus Tacitus virtually expresses his
private conviction that the charge, though it could not be directly
brought home to the emperor, was substantially true. See also ch.
44, 7 ; 45, 28 i. Dio Cass. LXVI. 20 accuses Domitian directly oi the
, murder oi Agricola. Speciem, eta: ln his countenance he exhibited
what was to pass as an indication ol sincere grief of heart. With the
phrase, cp. Cic. Vevr. Ι. 8, 21, eripiebam animi dolorem vulta tepere,

15. piissimae: this superlative was censured by Cic. Phil. XIII.

ing to an ancient grammarian (Pompeius), Cicero employed it himself
in his Lattara, and it is certainly a recognized form in post-Augustan
Latin, belng especially common in sepulchral inscriptions. Domi·
tianum: the omissiones an epithet is douhtless intended to heighten
the contrast with the preceding laudatory superlativas.

16. honore iudicioque: os a oeovlt os honor aad a sincere conv-
pllment. ’

18. bono petre . . . malum principem: the antithesis is empha-
sized, as often, by alliteration. See Iretrod. p. xxviii. The custom
oi bequeathing part oi an estate to the emperor, so as to prevent its
confiscation, was common. See note Diol. 13, 19.
