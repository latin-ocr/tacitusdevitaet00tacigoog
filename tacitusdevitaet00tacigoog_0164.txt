cp. the similar description oi the Dead Sea in Tac. ITrst. V. 6, neque
uento impellitur. . . inertes undae superiacto, ut solido, serunt.

22. rariores: used predicatively, though in attributive position
(ε rarius occurrunt), and correlative with tardius, ior the apposition
causo, etc, can apply only to terrae monitusque. The construction is
exceedingiy common in T. causa et materia: oriyin und occu·
sion. Tacitus is iond oi combining words denoting origin. So ag.
Germ. 9, 29, causa et oripo.

24. aestus: this phenomenon was naturally a source oi astonish-
ment to the Romans, as there are scarcely any tides in the Meditor·
ranean. neque . . . ac: doesnel soll within tlte scope os ilis work
und besides. This collocation seems to occur in but one other passage
in extant writers, viz. Suet. Vesp. 12, uc having the same force as here.
See note to l. 19.

25. multi rettulere: ag. Aristotle, Pytheas, Strabo, Diodorus, ·

496. huc atque iiiuc terre: ebbs ond fleus, ie. the high tides send
huga volumes oi water iar up the iriths and rivers, and on receding at
low tide leave the channal all but dry.—Elsewhere T. uses luc illuc,
occasionaily hucque et illuc, and once luc uel illuc.

29. velut in suo: as ii they were stili a part oi the ocean’s bed.
With the personification we may cornpare, Germ. 30, 24, Chattos suos
soltus Hercynius prosequitur sinui ac deponit.

Ohapter 11. 30. Ceterum: but to return aiter this digression,
which was non lutus operis, to the description oi Britain. Ceterum
often has this resumptive force in Tacitus. Cp. note Dici. 26, 6.
qui . . . coluerint: probably modeled upon sali. Iup 17, 7, sed qui
mortales initio Africum coluerint, etc.

Pago 8. 1. indigenae: this was the opinion oi Timaeus and
