0110010116. 18. populls: on this so-called subiective dative, see
note ch. 3, 30. urbis: 10. lortified towns. The lact, to which
Tacitus here appeals as one 01 common knowledge, is amply attested
hy references in other authors. In the 4th century, victorious Ger-
man tribes were still averse to occupying towns which they regarded
as munimento seruitii (Tac. Hiat. IV. 64). This repugnante, due
to their nomadic instincte, was not overcome till the llth century
under Henry, the founder 01 011100 (der Stddteyriiader). The late
occurrence 01 the German word stadt (city), is also confirmative 01 the
above statement.

19. ne pati quidem: olo aot take lticdly to, do not like. Inthis
weakened sense, pati is quite common, eg. ch. 42, 8, 43, 10; Dial.
10, 21; 40, 26. interae iunctas redte: coiitiyuoas droellinpe.
The clause is joined asyndetically, the infinitive depending upon
notumest. Colunt: diocli.

20. discreti ac diversi: separatety aad promiscuoualy. The
Latin is fond 01 such alliterative groups 01 synonyma. Cp. Cic. pro
10011100. 4, 9, locis disiunctissimis. . . discreta· Lucret. V. 1441,
divisa . . . discretoque tellua‚· and below, l. 21. 111. . . 111 . . . ut:
note the effective anaphora. The statement is, in a measure, con-
firmed hythe endings 01 many modern city names, ag. Lauterbrun-
nen, Ansbach (sons), Bieleield, Lindenau (campus), Fuerstenwalde,
Wernigerode (11001110).

21. Vlcoe: a group 01 homesteads. 0011οκ10. . . aedificiis
seems to be a merely redundant amplification 01 inter 00 10110100 aedes.
Cp. note ch. 15, 6. The supposition that Tacitus means 10 distinguish
the dependent iarmsteads and the dwellings oi the free, including
the manor 01 the lord, 10 1101 confirmed hythe context, though such
differences unquestionably existed.

22. spatio: an open space or yard ienced in.

23. slve. . . sive: these clauses are an'explanatory apposition 01
spatio circumdat, although the Germans' ignorance 01 stone buildings
isin itsell the reason, why precautions against fire were imperatively
called 101.

24. Ne caementorum.. . tegularum: explains wherein this
inscitia aedificandi consisted, 00111 being, as 011011, omitted, ag. Ayr.
13, 15. This is confirmed by the observation that the German words
for other than wooden material, such as cement, chalk‚ mortar, brich,
tile, etc, are 01 Latin origin.

25. materia: timber. So eg. Caes. B. 11. IV. 17, 83 Anu. 1. 35,
