of further aggressive campaigns, by showing what formi-
dable and invincible enemies these Germans had been in the
past. It thus constituted, though only by shrewd implica
tion, the very hey-note of the trectise. But if sc, the inser·
tion of this passage was singularly tactless and insulting, in

. that the author would have depreciated the ability of so great

a general, as Trajan admittedly was, to eope successfully
with these foes, on the ground that all his predecessore had
ignominously failed. Again, in a political pamphlet, de·
sigued for the immediate present, the statement that it was
written in the second consulship of Trajan would be as gra
tuitous as if an American pamphleteer today, in an article
written for the American publio, were to tell his readers
that the Philippine insurrection occurred during the third
year 'of McKinley’s administration. In a scientific mono
graph, however, elaborated into aworh of literary art and as
such intended for posterity, the chronological data referred
to are eminently proper. The entire chapter was, moreover,
so manifestly suggested by the incidental mention of the
Cimbri, once so powerful but now so insignificant, that the
assumption of any ulterior purpose forits insertion is in no
way justified.

Flnally, the very style of the Germanic precludes its
⁵ having ever been intended as a political pamphlet, for this
imperatively called for a distinctively oratorical treatment,
belonging, as it did, to what the ancient rhetorioians term

, the λόγος ψόγου, the opposite of the encomium.¹

We must, therefore, conclude that the treatise de origine,

1Many have taken refuge in a kind of compromise, and speak ol
an ethico-political treatise, but this, apert from being open to the
objections pointed out above, is quite incompatible with the as·
sumption that its author was a practical statesman who wrote for
contemporaries in support of a definite policy. Tacitus was nota
philosophica] rhetoriolan and political theorist like Isocrates.
