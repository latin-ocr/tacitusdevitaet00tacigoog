tha Chauci and the Semnones, hut not the Cherusci, can be here
understood.

26. per obsequium: like the Cherusci, ior example.

27. prosilisse periclitando: bg arms aad cypressino. On the
alliterative grouping, see Iatrod. p. lxviii, and on the favorite Tacitean
collocation oi aper clause with an ablative, see ibid. p. lxx. Veli. Pat.
l.c. styles the Langobardi gens etlam Germancserltote ferocior, and
their later history in a measure confirma this statement. Reudigni:
on the location oi these small tribes, ot whom, with the exception of
the Anglii and Varini, the ancients knew aa little as we do, see map.
deinde in a local sense, occurs in Tacitus only here, ch. 42, 1 ; 44, 9, and
is generally rare, eg. Liv. XXII. 4, 2, but dein isvery commonly so used.

28. Aviones: not elsewhere mentioned. Anglii: the same
wh0, under Hengist and Harsa in the oth century, invaded Britain.
Ilthnologically they seem ιο have belonged to the same gens as the
Varini, the Warm' of later times. They are probably 'identical with
the Thuringians in middle Germany, whence they migrated ιο the
Schleswig peninsula, the Anglii having, it would seem, preceded them.
This hypothesis would plausibly account ior the title ot their oldest
law: lesAngliol-am ct Wers'aorum, boc cst Thurinyorcm. Eudoses :
unless the order followed by Tacitus is quite haphazard, which is in-
compatible with the systematic plan oi these geographical chapteis,
his authorities or map must have placed this tribe south, not north, oi
the Anglii and Varini. They are generally identified with the later
Jutes and supposed to be the sameas the Φουνδούσιοι oi Ptolemaeus,
who locatas them near the Cimbri (see map); but there is no evidence
ior either of these identificatione. flnarddnes: a wholly unknown
tribe, the very name being variously given in the Mss. Its location
is, therefore, purely conjectural.

Paga 53. 1. Vitdnes: according to others, Nuithones, but this
name is also hopelessly corrupted in our Mss. Polysyndetic et, more
than twice repeated, is rare in Tacitus and exclusively confined to the
minor works. Cp. note Dici. 10, 14. fluminibus aut silvis: so
combined again, Aac. II. 19. The phrase is peculiarly applicable to
the regions where we must suppose these tribes to have dwelt.
Nec quicquam . . . ln conmune: slightly illogical, ior we expect
either nec . . . inillis, nisi quod, or aec . . . in singulis, secl ia eom-

mcne. Cp. ch, at, l ii.; Aac. 111. 27, noc modo ia cosmate, sed
ia angulos homines.
