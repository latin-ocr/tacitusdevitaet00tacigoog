readily to rhetorical treatment, worthy ol attention though
it be.

To relieve the weary monotony of geographical names
with which the rhetorician found himself confronted, re·
course is accordingly had to stylistic embellishment. As
regards ethnologioal details, which Mela distributos with a
lavish and reckless hand, it may be said that there is per-

haps no ancient treatise, professedly scientific and didactic,
which so teems with grotesque information, culled from the

rich storehouse of Hellenic fancy, myth, and anecdote3 for
everything is grist that comes to his rhetorical mill. Pliny
the Elder, omnivorous reader that he was», does, indeed, cite
the Choroprophic of Mela as among his sources, but there-
after all genuine traces of its influence disappear until
the early Middle Ages. The value which attaches to it in
modern times is solely due to the accident that it is the
earliest geographical treatise extant in Latin, and that it

contains no fewer than fifteen hundred geographioal names.¹

Now, the third chapter of the third book, comprising less
than fifty lines, is devoted to Germany, and to this extremely
meagre account we are asked to believe that Tacitus was
· under deep obligation for many details of fact, while his
stylistio indebtedness to this rhetorioian is made'to extend
over the entire compilation.² But to suppose that Tacitus

1Mela seems to haye been chiefly indehted to a geographicalwork
oi Cornelius Nepos, who is expressly quoted, and to some map, perhaps
that of Agrippa. Eudoxus, Hipparchus, and Hanno, though also cited,
were doubtless known to the author only at second or third hand.

αΗονν deeply rooted this conviction is, will *he best illustrated hy
the fact that all recent editors have had no scruples to change radit to
recedit (ch. 35, 2), simply because ol a similar passage in Mela, and
yet the unanimous reading of the Mss. is not only wholly unobjection-
able, but it is supported by Vergil, and, finally, by none other than
Mela himself! See note ad loc. and Crit. Appendix.
