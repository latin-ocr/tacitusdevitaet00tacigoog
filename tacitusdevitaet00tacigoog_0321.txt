monio literature ot the Middle Ager, in significant contrast with its
extravagant praises oi spring.

Ohapter 21. The account of Germanic funeral customs appropri-
ately closes the ethnological portione oi the treatise

25. ambitio: display. Fimerals in Rome were, ou the contrary,
conducted on so lavishascale that laws were repeatedly eneoted against
the abusa. For the meaning oi the word, op. eg. Apr. 29, 23; Hist.
IV. 40; Ana. IV. 62; and Seu. de brea. ait. 20, 4.

26. certis ligula: such astho pino, beech, and oalr. These customs
are abundantly illustrated by the Beowuli. Cp. eg. vs. 3110, Rode be
ibeo order. . . ibat alep ibe fiee-wood Stould bring srom asar.
crementur: burial seems to aniedate the buming ot bodies. In the
bronze age, the latter seems to have been the rule; thereaiter we find
both modes of disposing oi the dead existing side by side. Uuless we
suppose that Tacitus is here speaking only oi clari 0112110 would
imply that cremetion alone was practised by the Germane, and this
seems, indeed, confirmed by passages oi the Beowuli and the numerous
charred remains that have been discovered, although unbnrned skale-
tons have also occasionally turned up in old graves. cremation was
finally absolutely prohibited under charles the Great.

27. Struem rogi, etc: pare strodere ,¹ rope· is a noteworthy
example of the epexegetical genitive. nec vestibus nec odorl-
bns cumulant: as was frequently done in Rome. Cp. the account
of the burial oi Germanicus in Ana. III. 2, vestem odores aliaque
superam sollemnia cremabant. sua culque mma: this is con-
firmed egby Beowuli 3137, For blm then prepared ibe sollo . . . A
funeral pyre . . . Haay soilli belmeis, atat abields os soar, and it is
attested as late as the eleventh century by Adam oi Bremen, IV. 81,
tumulant cam eo armaque ,· but that this oustom was not exclusively
Germanic is shown by Verg. Aen. VI. 233, impunitaem amna circ.
On the ellipsis oi sed, cp. Introd. p. lxvii. Ι

28. quorumdam so. mobiliorem. equus efficitur: so ag. in
the case oi Baldr (in the Edda) and ot Epill. The Gothic king
Alema was buried full armed‚ together with his steed, aud a horse's
head was found at Toumay‚ in 1653, 111 the grave oi King Childerich.
Sepulcrum caespes erigit: a bold figure, also used by Son. Epist.
8, ὃ, banc domam . . ‚caespes ereaemt. Cp. also ch. 46, 83 Hier.
V. 6, praecipuam manlium Libanum eripit (sc. Iudaea) ; Ape. 12, 2.

29. monumentorum arduum et operosum: hypallage ior m.
