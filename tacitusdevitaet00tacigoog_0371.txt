284 , sorus. cessans 4e. [100101

The following highly rhetorical passage furnishes the best extent
example of the ianciiul idealizatiou 01 unknown northern races so
characteristic 01 the ancients from Homer down. cp. Introd. p. lxiii
All the Germanic traits oi the Feuni are accentuated, while the ethni-
cal distinctions are all careiully enumerated and invented with a halo
oi romanoe. Some of the ¹colors oi the picture seem to have been con-

. tributed by Lucretius. See below.

1³. non. . ,non. . . non: on the anaphora here and again ll. 19.
22, sec Introd. p. lxvii. penates: i. e. they have no family life or
flxed habitations. Cp. ch. 15, 8 3 25, l i. victui herba: le. they
have no agriculture, but such vegetable foed as they use grows wild.
This could, 01 course, be true only ior the summer, bnt Tacitus habitu·
ally ignores the winter 10 his account 01 the remote north, doubtless
because the irrioimation available to him was originally gaibered by
tradens who would visit these regions only in summer. See ll. 181.
and note ch. 45, 26. The slight contradiction between this statement
aud l. 151. must not be too closely pressed iu a description so largely

. imaginative‚ particularly as it may have been in part caused by the

Lucretian reminiscence cited below.

14. cubile humus: cubile ior cubili is intentionally used to mark
the close oi the asyndeton, similar devices being characteristic oi Taci-
tean style. The same phrase occurs, eg. Curi. 1112, 5, 15. With
the entire passage, cp. Lucret. V. 816, terra cibum pueris, uestem vapor,
herba cubile. solae . . . opes: their only resources 0000101 iu, as
contrasted with the primitive conditione just mentioned (uon crura . . .
humus). quas. . . ossibus separant: whose points they tip with
boue. This is said to have been the practice 01 the Sarmatiam (Pausan.
1. 21, 5) and the Huns (Amm. Marc. XXXI. 2, 9), and it is still in
vogue in Lapland andin northern Siberis.

16. elit: the verb is here perhaps used in tbe figurative sense 01
giving occupatiore io, for to say that both men and women partoolr of
the geme is a gratuitons and seli-evident statement, not to mention
that partem . . . petunt would thus be an intolerable tautology.
The whole passage simply describes an active out-door llic, taken up
ior the most part with the chase. passim :‘ iu ull directions, de·
rived irom pande, io spread. Ιο Tacitus this meaning occurs only here
aud Hist. 1.81; Anu. VI. 50; XI. 32. comitantur: sc. feminae
viros. partem praedaepetunt: alliterative. The entirestatement
is confirmed by Procopius (6111 century), whose description oi the Fenni
in general is in remarkable agreement with the account 01 Tacitus.
