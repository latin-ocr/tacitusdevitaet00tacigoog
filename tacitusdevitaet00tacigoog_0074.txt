vivid description or analytic reflectione that his dictiones
well becomes pitched in a higher kcy. So far, then, from
exhibiting auniform type, the style of this treatise ebbs and
flows, as it were, with the character cf the subject-matter,
rauging from severely condenscd' narration to passages oi
genuine eloquence and rhetorical art,l thus giving to the ¹
entire work that σεμνότης, or serious dignity of expression,
which Pliny the Younger ascribed to the speeches of
Tacitus, and which may justly be applied to everything else
that this great writer ever penned.

An equally conspicuous feature of his style is its brecity,
though this is less notioeahle in the speeches andin the .
numerous elevated passages, which from their very nature
called lor greater rhetorical elaboration. This conciseness
is chiefly brought about through the omission of all parts of
speech which an attentive reader could himself supply in
thought, the ellipsis of the copulo and partiales being espe-
cially frequent. But what distinguishes the Germanic more
particularly from all other Tacitean works is the extent to
which all pcrtcda’c structure is avoided. Our treatise is hence
largely made up of very short sentences, and it thus ap·
proaches closely in this respect to the socalled Asianic type
of composition,² which in Latin literature is best represented
by Seneca. In Tacitus, however, this mode of writing is
throughout solely a means to an end, admirably subserving
the double purpose of crowding his multifarious and exten-
sive information within a very small compasse, and at the
same time of bringing each single item into prominent and
clearout relief. The reader is thus enabled to survey the
