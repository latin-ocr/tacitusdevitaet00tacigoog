19. delectos: elsewhere in the minor writings Tacitus has eligere.
On this change oi usage, cp. note Dici. 10, 31. ante aciem: as the
place oi honor. Cp. ch. 31, 22.

20. Definituretnumems: sc. peditum deiectorum, just mentioned,
ior that the equitatus was an elite corps is taken ior granted. The
present passage, therefore, merely distinguishes between a, select
infantry and the rank and file of pedites, called acies below. Observe
the emphatic position oi the predicate: aad whot's aiore, evea their
number is fiued. centeni ex singulis pagis: the decima] system
in military and political organizations is primitive Indo-Europaeo, and
particularly conspicuous among the Hindoos, Persians, and Romans.
A padua according to Caes. Β. G. lV. l, 4, formed the one-hundredth
partui a geas or ciuitas, contributing annually a thousand soldiers,
which would thus correspond to the Roman tribus. A hundred delecti
pedites (the equites are here not discussed for the reason given
above) would, therefore, constitute a sufficiently small contingent to
make it a distinction and au honor to belong ιο it. That the exact
one hundred was occasionally exceeded seems to be implied in quod
primo uumerus suit, the original designation being traditionally
retained, as in the analogous case oi the Roman centumuiri and oi
the German ceataer, which in different localities and at different times
was equivalent to 110 pounds. Cp. also note ch. 12, 27.

21. idque ipsum: viz, triaduri, tuadarod, butadertschast.
quod: ior qui. On thc neglect oi the attraction, cp.ch.18, 13 and
note ιο Apa 21, 3. Ι

22. nomen: title. On the singular predicate, see Iatrod. p. lxix.
Acies: here the common soldicry‚ as opposed to the equites and
delecti pedites. per cuneos: awedgelike, compact formation, like
a Greek Δ. From its sbape, the Romans compared icto a boar's head
(ceput porci). This method oi formation was still in use as late as
the battle of Hastings (1066 aa).

2³. cedere loco: this was in marked contrast to Roman disci-
pline and is sneeringly alluded to by Germanicus in his speech on the
eve oi the battle ol ldisiaviso. Cp. Ana. 11. 14, siae cura ducum obire,
supere, and ch. 30, 8. dummodo=dma In 'tacitus only here
and Diui. 25, 14. consilii quam=c potius quoue, a prees os
diaeretica rather thau os sear. This peculiar ellipsis, probably a col·
loquialism, occurs first in Plaut. Eud. (va. 1114), tacitast beau veredice
seraper quam loquens. In 'l'acitus it is found in fiiteen other passages,
but only here in the minor works. The genitives may be regarded
