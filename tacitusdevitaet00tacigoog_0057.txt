necessarily derived wholly at second laced, it is to the high-
est degree probable that the amount of authentic informa
tion which came to him through the medium of friends and
eye-witnesses of things Germanic was far more extensive
than has generally beeu assumed, particularly as we have
positive evidence that Tacitus, in his Histortes and Artrtals,
repeatedly availed himself of such exceptional opportunities.¹

But, however considerable the material so accumulated
may have been, the great bulh of his informatiou cannot
well have been due to other than literory sources.

Julius Caesen—The earliest Roman description of Ger-
manic life and customs is contained in' a few paragraphs of
Caesar's Gallio Wcr·‚² That Tacitus knew these famous
Commentaries, would go without saying, even if he had not
expressly referred to their author in a highly complimentary
manner.³ In view of this fact, scholars have without ex-
ception assumed that this work was among the principal
and direct sources of Tacitus, although the demonstrable
acquaintance with an earlier account, be it never so famous,
does not in itself imply that it was also extensively con-
sulted. As the work in question is fortunately extant, the

’ alleged indebteduess of Tacitus can still be determined with

1cp. Ph. Fabia, Lcs Scarces de Tacite, pp. 220-222, 342-346; and
esp. Plin. Epist. VI. 16, 1, petis ut tibi coarmati met exitam scribam

quo verius tradere posteris poesis.

2 IV. 1-4 (concerning the Suebi) ; VI. 21-24‚ to which are added
three chaptcrs (25-28) ou the Hercynian forest and its wonderful
fauna, incidental references being also found in the first book, esp.
ch. 31-54.

³Ch. 28, 6, sarmatae auctorum divus Iulius tradit, etc. It is the
solitary passage in the treatise in which an author is mentioned by
name, and it is, perhaps, not without significance that the only other
allusion to the De Bello Gallico in Tacitus (viz. Agr, 11, 16) pertaius
to the identical statement there made concerning the degeneracy oi
the Gaulo.
