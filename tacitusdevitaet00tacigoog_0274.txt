VI. 21, 2, says deorum numero cos soloe ducant, pace cernant et
quoram aperte opibus icebantur, Solem ct Vulcanum ct Lucam: reii-
quos ac samo quidem acceperant. This was doubtless not true oi the
Germans in general, ior their religion was certainly not amere nature-
worship. It may, however, in Caesar’s time, have been partly appli— .
oable ιο some tribe or tribes living on the Rhine, the cult being borrowed
by them from the Gauls. This hypothesis would, at least, in ameasure
account ior the curicus mixture still surviving in names ior the week.

Tacitus, the Suebic rece was by iar the most widely diffused oi all
Germanic peoples (see ch. 38 ii.) ; but, as a goddess Nehalennia was
worshipped with similar rites by the Suebic branch which Augustus
transplanted to Flanders from the upper Rhine and Danube, it is not
improbable that she represents the Isis oi Tacitus.

29. Isidi: this is not an instance oi interpretatio Romano, ior the
antiquarians consulted by Tacitus did not, ae elsewhere, identiiy the
German cult with a Roman one on the basis oi similar attributes, but
inibis case assumed direct importation, because they tancied that the
