19. laureatis : sc. litteris. The laurei, being the symbol ci martial
victories, was sent with the official reports which commandere ior-
warded to the emperor. -The eiiiptieai phrase seems to occur only
here and Hist. 111. 77.

20. lamae lamam: ior a similar chiasmus, cp. Ana I. 39, lepti
ins popuii Romani Romanis in castris. aestimantibus, eta: ie.
peopie reasoned that a stili greater lutura was in stare ior a man who
could be reticent about achievements so noteworthy. -The construc-
tion is probably an eiiiptical dative rather than an ablat abs.; see note
oh. 34, 30.

21. tem magna: more emphatic than tenta and comparativeiy
rare. -With the thought, cp. Justin. XI. 1, ita moderate ‹tc se merita
pollicitus eat, at adpareret plara enm experimentis reservare, aad
Ana. ΙΙ. 22, de se nibil addit, iaetu tractatae aa ratas conscientiam
sacto satis esse.

Ohapter 19. 22. animorum .. prudens: aeti acquainted aith
tire temper.

’ 23. doctus per aliens experimenta: tanpbt ap the experiente
os attera Sthai.34,16,eraditas . . . alienis experimentis. For
the meaning oi experimentum, see note ch. 16, 24.

24. excidere: remove, eradicate. Cp. Cic. deprecaturam,
43, tristissimum tempera . . . ea animo . . . excidere. Surgical
or medical metaphora are comparatively rare in Tacitus and else·
where in Latin, except in Cicero, who had a peculiar fondness ior
them.

2⁷. nihil, etc: sc. apere. Such ellipses oi a verb oi doing or
acting, though not unusual, are particularly frequent in Tacitus. Cp.
Introd. p. xxxi. publicae rei: publio bnaness. So again Germ.
13, 30. In this sense, the adjective must precede, because rer pab-
tica always has its restricted political meaning, but in other combina-
tions with res in Tacitus, the attribute as a ride follows the noun.
See Iatrod. p. xxvi.

29. ascire sed optimum. . . putare = ascire sed optimum . . .
ascire auia eam . . . patabat. ’ On the prolepsis, see Introd. p. xxx:

30. exsequi: ie. while he kept himseii iniormed oi everything,
hadid not always oct upon this knowledge. The word, as shown
hy poena below, cannot here signiiy to punish, a meaning, moreover,
not found elsewhere in Tacitus, though common in Livy. With the
statement itseii, cp. Introoi. p. xii. 2.
