14. et = etiam. superasse tantum itineris: the phrase seems ¹

1V.62; Lucret. V. 8165 Quint. X. 1, 99; Plin. Epist. VI. 20, 14. The ,
antithetical clauses are also in chiastic order. With the entire pas-
sage, ci. Liv. XXI. 43, 9, tontum itineris per tot montes fluminaque
. . . emensos, and esp. Curi. VI. 3, 9, 16, and on the rhetorical com·
monplaces characteristic of military speeches, see Iatrod. p. xxxvi.

15. in frontem = progredientibus, which was avoided ior euphonia
ressone, sapientibus following. The phrase is unparallcled, but ia
often has the meaning towards, and the term was probably coined on

without the addition oi hostibus. -On the ellipsis of aad, extremely
common in antitheses oi this kind, see Iatrcd. p. xxxi.

Sall. Cat. 58, 16; Liv. XXVII. 13, 7.

21. Proinde = itaque. et honesta mors, turpi vita potior,
et: this sentiment is also a commonplace, eg. Eur. Peleus, fragm.

22. eodem loco sita sunt: 22. 2 noble death for one’s country
or a glorious victory depends upon the issue of this battle-This alter-
native is 2 rhetorical τόπος 111 many of these speeches. cp. Liv. XXI.
43, 4, and esp. Dio Cass. LXII. ll, ἢ οὖν περιγενώμεθα 211τῶνῆ ἐνταῦθα
