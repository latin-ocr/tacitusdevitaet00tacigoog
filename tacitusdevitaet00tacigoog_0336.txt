⁵. prout ferox bello et melior: accordiap ae lie isflcrre in aar
and iu scot a better maa, viz. than the oldest son. As concinionum
maior nata, has preceded, we should expect optimas, prout seros being
virtually equivalent ιο ¹ferocissimas quisque. Bello, as belonging to
both seraa and melior, is, according to 'l'ecitean usage, placed between
them. See Iri-rod. p. lxvi.

Ohaptcriiss. ὅ. Bructeri: on their position, see map. Tbey
were inveterate enemies oi Rome, taking part in the battle of the
Teutoburg forest (9 an.) and in the uprising under Civilis. The
prophetess Veleda, mentioned oh. 8, 23, belonged to this tribe.
The disaster which is here said to have overtaken the Bructeri was
probably in a civil war, in which the Romans intervened. Cp. l’lin.
Epist. VII. 2, written about the seme time as the Germania. Subse
quently they seem to have recovered from the blcw; at all events,
we meet with them frequently down to the tirno oi the Venerable
Bede (iith century). occurrebant: cqcbarrt. In Tacitus only
here in this sense.

7. chamavos: according to Aure. Xlll. 55, they dwelt origi·
nally on the lower Rhine‚ between the Batavi, Frisii, aud Bructeri.
They were finally absorbed by the Franks. Angrivfirios: see map.
Their name does not disappear till the time of Charles the Great.
narratur: the impersonal corntruction with the accusative with the
infinitive, though the original one in Latin and common wltlr verbs
like tradi, dici, existimari, etc, is extremely rare with narrari, ag.
Ovid, Met. XV. 3113 Plin. Ν. Η. XXXV. 11, 38, 121.

8. paene tum excisis: Tacitus habitually thus modities whatmlght
seem an exaggerated expression ; with paene or prope, eg. Apr. 18, 21 3
33, 4; Hist. l. to; 80, 2. vicinarum: note the emphatic position.

9. praedae dulcedine: ephraea of frequent occurrence, ag. Hist.
II. 7, d. praedarum. The genitive elsewhere invariably follows; here
it precedes, so that the last end amplified member of the polysyndeton
may close with e chiesmus. cp. Iatrod. p. lxvii.

10, favore . . . deomm: reflectione on this eubJ'ect are frequent
in Tacitus, but vary considerably. cp. eg. Hist. IV. 78, nec siue ope
dicias. . . ierpa victores oer·iere,· 81, multa miracala creuere . . .
qais caelestisfaror . . . in Vespasianum . . . ostenderetur, with Ι, 13,
nec enim amquam atrocioribus papali Romani cladibus . . ,capro-
hatrrm est nou esse carae deis securitatem nostram, asse altionem,
spectaculo . . . invidere: either ablative, with uobis to be supplied
