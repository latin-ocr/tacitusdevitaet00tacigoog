17, a much more emphatic phrase than the one referring to the Cale·

donians in ch. 22, ὁ. crebris . . . domuit: cp. what is said oi
the equally unsucoessiul invasion oi Britain by Caesar, ch. 13, 17 ff.-
On the position oi simul, see note ch. 6, 23, and Iatrod. p. xxvi.

2. eamque: -que in joining sentences never adds entirely unre-
lated ideas, hence the first paragraph cannot reier to the Caledo

3. adspicit: ior the more usual spectat, probably because Ireland
is actually visible from some parts of the English coast. copiis in-
struxit: 11 thie paragraph pertained to a campaign against the Cale-

’ Mediterranean, by 22‚401 square miles.

9. ingenia cultusque . . . differunt: observa the symmetrical
grouping with solum caelumque. The same phrase occurs in Mela, 11.
