atthis particular point in the narrative, because the above-mentioned
successes were won at some distance from headquarters, and without
the general's previous knowledge or upon his initiative, afact utilized
by the biographer to emphasize certain noteworthy qualities oi Agric-
ola, which this circumstance had revealed, ‘and his readiness to
bestow praise in turn naturally leads to a briei statement concerning
