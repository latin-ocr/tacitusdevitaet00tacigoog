111 Ana. ΙΙ. 50, cited below, the word being here, as usually, taken in
a restricted sense. cp. note ch. 0, 11. 11 would seem that her cloalr
was torn 011 and her dress cut at the back. coram propinquis:
ie. the relatives 01 110111 husband and wile. Their presence implied
approval 01 the punishment, and would thus correspond to the actual
trial 01 the wife before her husband and relatives, who served as
assessore, aprocedure often mentioned as an old Roman custom, and
said to have been introduced by Romulus. Cp. Dionys. Halic. Arcb.

12. peromnem vicum: through tte entire village. verbere
agit: cp. the passage in an old law 01 the Lombards, publicus . . .
sociat eas decalvare (= abscisis crinibus) et fastuve per vicos ,· and in
the famous letter 01 St. Boniiace, written in 715 111, 10 the Anglo-
Sason king Ethelbald, we find a very similar statement, flagellatam
earn mulieres per pagos . . . ducant, virgis caedentes et vestimenta
eius abscidentes tecta cingulum . . . 111 ceterae timorem adulterandi
babeant. publicatae enlm, etc: enim, with the usual
ellipsis to be supplied. This may seem a very severe punishment
ior the 1001101010,5011110501111111011111 cece brought to public notice
(in the way described) finds 110 pcrdoa wdctsoever.

1³. pudicitiae: 1110101101, disproce, amsaning quite common in
its synonym, pudor.. Engl. 11101110 is equally ambiguous. For avery
bold transferente 01 a positive into its negative, cp. Lucret. V. 1405,
10111110 (= 1011111 of sleep).

14. maritum sc. olium or alterum, es is clear from the pre-
ceding and the following, esp. l. 1511. For 11 similar ellipsiS, cp. ch.

15. conrumpere et contempl: so joined in Aen. XlV. 20, and
similarly 111. 54, coarmatus simul et corruptor. Tacitus osten thus
combines the active and the passive 01 the same verb, eg. Apa 5, 28, .
noscere . . . nosci ; Dial. 8, 17, acceperint . . . occepi possit. cp.
also note ch. 38, 0. saeculum: the 1111111 os the cpe, the cocy of
the world. In this sense the word does not seem to occur elsewhere.
Meliusquldemadhnc sc. apaan cre indeed still better off ; adhuc:
etiam is often used in post-Augustan Latin to strengthen a comparative.
With the ellipsis 01 a verb 01 doing, frequent ln Tacitus, cp. eg. Agr.
