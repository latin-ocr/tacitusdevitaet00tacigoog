all that seemed to him of real value, may also be asserted
with entire confidence3 but the moment we approach the
question as to the specific extent of his direct indebtedness
to his predecessors, we are confronted with a problem as
difficultas it is fascinating.

The possible sources of Tacitus lor the Gerrucnlo may be
classified under three heads : —

1. Firsthand information gathered by the author him-
self in German territory through personal interviews and
observatione.

2. Information, chiefly oral, furnished by personal friends
or military officers who had been in Germany or on the

. frontier.

3. Literary records dealing incidentally or exclusively
with German ethnology and geography.

The first possibility, though strenrrously advocated by
many scholars,l must, however, be rejected, for the treatise
does not contaiu a solitary item which could be accounted
for only on the supposition of a personal visit, not to men·
tion that such a jour-noy of exploratior would have been
next to impossible on the part of a Roman, even in those ·
regions to which Roman legions had at one time or another
penetrated. Finally, a number oi passages in the treatise
itsell would necessarily have been expressed differently il
Tacitus had himself come into contact with the people
whom he describes²

But while the author's knowledge oi Germany was thus
