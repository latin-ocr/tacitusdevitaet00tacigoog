take it all the more to beart, ii their women are captured. Nomine, a
phrase seemingly taken from commercial liie occurs repeatedly iu
Tacitus and elsewhere. Sacram is superfluous, but here adds a touch
oiaiiection. Cp. also ch. 13, 103 30, 24. Translate: They haee 1111

19. animi: peaceable disposition, tlte bearis, the civitas being con-
ceived rather es an aggregate oi individuale than a political organiza
tion. Similar quasi-personiiications are frequent, eg. 119119, 22;
Hist. 1.11; civitatum et provinciaram animos adcrescas; IV. 66,
percuisis civitatum aniciis.

20. puellae quoque nobiles: the st'ress, as shown by qaoque, is
on paellae. The emphatic position oi the adjective was, however,
necessary to avoid the collocation tator obsides nobiles, paellae qaoque,
which could only mean that the affection iu which the Germans held
their women rendered noble birth a less essential qualification than in
the case of the male hostages. With tbe statement itseli, cp. Suet.

21. aliquid: on the medial position, see Iatrod. p. lxvi. provi-
dum: prescierit, trispircd. This belief is abundantly attested. Cp.
Caes. Ba. Ι.1”10,.4; Suet. Viteii. 14, vaticinante Chatta muliere cai
111111 ordeacio acquiescebat (sc. Vitellius). The Gothic king Filimer,
a Christian, expelled crapas marlieres, and references to them are ire-
quentin the Teutonic epics. The tenacity with which such women,
in particular, would cling to pagan traditione made them an especial
object oi attack on the'part 01 the Christian propagaudists. By the
time oi Charles the Great tbeir influeuee seems 10 have been broken,
and we hear no more 01 them, until they revive in the witches 01 the
Mlddle Ages. nec: aec ideo, as often in Tacitus. consilia
. . . responsa: the former, as shown by adspernantur, are unso-
licited. So iar, Tacitus means to say, arethe Germans from being
indifferent to the answers oi their wise women, that they do not even
reject advice which they had not themselves requested. Cp. Plut. dc
ntulier. virtut. 6 (p. 246 C.) of the Celts: περὶ πολέμου καὶ εἰρήνης
βουλευόμενοι μετὰ τῶν γυναικῶν.
