LITERARY calescens or nus Aomcons. ix

It is asserted that the work contains too much historical
matter for a biography and too many biographical features
for a history. In the second place, the detailed account ol
the ethnology and geography of Britain, and the elaborate

speeohes put into the mouth of the Caledonian chieftain
end ol the Roman general on the eve of the decisive battle,
are pronounced to be wholly out of place in a genuine
biography. One ¹scholar even went so far as to maintain
that all these alleged irrelevant portione, to which he added
the twentyeighth chapter, commemorating the adventure
oi the Usipi, were not originally designed to form an in-
tegral part of this treatise, but represented certain prelimi-
nary studies of the author, the results of which were to
, be incorporated into'his Historias, in the narrative of the
British campaigns under Domitian. Apart from other con-
sideratione to he mentioned presently‚‘ this hypothesis
makes it extremely difficult to understand why the last
book of that work was not published till 109, if Tacitus
had as early as 97 already begun the collection of his ma
terialfor the reign of Domitian. As a matter ol fact, we
happen to know that as late as106 he was still searching
for information in connection with an event to be related
under the year 7 9 A.n.¹

But these objections are unwarranted, for not only do the
alleged sections so confidently pronounced irrelevant suh
serve a definite and legitimate purpose, but-what has
hitherto been overlooked—it can be shown that Tacitus
has carefully conformed to the rules of rhetorio laid down
for biographioal composition.²

qao aerius tradere posteris possis.

Aphthonius, Theon, Dexopater‚ but especially ol Menander’s περὶ
ἐπιδεικτικῶν, collected in the Rhetores Graeci ol Walz and of Spengel.
