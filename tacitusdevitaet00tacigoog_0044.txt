IV. POETICAL AND FIGURATIVE FEATURES.

As already remarked, the two authors who exerted the
greatest influence upon the style and vocabulary 01 Tacitus
are Vergil and Sallust ; but, irulisputable as this is, we must
guard against the temptation 01 regarding all striking par-

allelisms as 00 many direct reminiscenees. Many Vergilian -
phrases, and the same is true 01 Sallust, had, hythe time
Tacitus composed the Agricola, become common property.
In fact, 11 the prose 01 the postAugustan age be distin-
guished from the Ciceronian period hy one feature more
than another, it is its profound indebtedness to the language
of the poete,l Livy, whose phraseology 10 also under heavy
obligations to Vergil, standing at the threshold 01 this
movement. In the following some 01 the more noteworthy
01 the stylistic parallelisms between Tacitus and earlier
writers pointed out in the Notas, are briefiy summarized:
