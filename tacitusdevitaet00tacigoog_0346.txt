Romans at Ticinus, the Trebia, Lake Trasimene‚ and above all Cannae
(216 ac). non Hispaniae: the reference is to the severe losses
sustained hythe Romans in the Celtiberiae and Lusitanian revolts,
under Viriathus, and before Numantia (let—139 aa). Galliaeve:
as Caesar’s campaigns are referred to below, the allusion is here more
probably to the battle 01 the Allia, the sack oi Rome (390—389 r.c.), the
Gallie ware during 238-236 01111226-222, particularly the bloody battle
01 Clusium (225 n.c.), though this latter ,eventually ended witha
Roman victory. The change from the singular to the plural, from the
names 01 people to the names oi countries, is a Tacitean device to
avoid monotony. Cp. esp. Ante. Il. 60, Libyn Aethiopia Mediaque et ¹
Persis et Bactriano ac Scytha potitum.

10. ne Parthi quidem: Rome's struggles with Parthia, beguu
under Caesar, had practically come to an end in the reign oi Augustus.
ne . . . quidem often closes an anaphoric or asyndetic enumeration, eg.
eh. 28, 24ς Dici. 40, 14. saepius admonuere: eocnded o more
frequent ciorne; the verb is used absolutely, as bere, also Anu.
XV. 45.

11. regno: despotiem. The word is never used by Tacitus except
oi barbarian monarchias. meanis: the founder 01 the Parthian
dynasty in 256 ac, which lasted till 226 nn, when it was supplanted
by the Sassanidae, the name having assumed a titular meaning, as
Caesar. Note the chiasmus acrior: hes a keener edne.

12. caedem Craeel: M. Crassus, the triumvir, was oruelly put to
death by the Parthians at the battle 01 Carrhae (in Mesopotamia),
June 9, 53 ac. etipse, lihewise, belongs to Oriens, as ir the abla
tive absolute were an aorist active participle in the nominative (καὶ
αὐτὸς Πάκορον ἀπολέσας). This usage, extremely rare elsewhere, occurs
repeatedly in Tacitus Cp. note Agr. 25, 7, diviso etipse . . . exercite.

1³. Pacdro: Pacorus, the iourteentb 01 the Arsacid dynasty, son
01 Orodes, the ally oi Brutus and Caesius, was defeated and slain by

death. inira Ventidium : P. Ventidius Boreae, at one time amule-
tecr, became pontifex maximus, praetor, and finally consul in 44 rec,
through the influenee 01 Caesar. As legatus 01 Antony he securcd
atriumph over the Parthians, and on his death was honored with a
public funerat Tacitus means to say that the Orient more than atoned
ior the murder oi Crassus, by the loss 01 Pacorus, and by being, as
an additional humiliation, trodden under ioot by a manci Ventidius'
antecedente. obiecerit: con eost into cnr teeth.
