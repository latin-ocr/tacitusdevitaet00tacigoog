nutrierunt: sostered. The entire statement is at variance with the
facts, ior the Cherusci were, down to the time oi Domitian, constantly
engaged in intertribal ieuds. Tacitus seems ιο attribute their degen-
eration to their undisturbed peace with the Romans rather than to
the struggles with their neighbors, which, as they did not strictly
partake oi regular warfare, were probably not considered by him as
conducive to military prowess‚ but to disintegration.

18. idque: viz. din paceni inlacessiti nutrire. On the agreement
with only a part oi the antecedent, see note ch. 8, 17. impe>
tentes: sc. Chattos, nnpocernable; so impotentia above.

19. validos: sc. Chaucos. · laiso quiescas: yrinruonidbenronp
in thinicinc yonrsels ct peace ataid, etc.; cp. si einnonem, para bellurn,
aprecaution attributed to the Chauci (ch. 35, 13 ff.) and Langobardi
ι (ch. 40, 27). The adverb expresses a judgment oi the author, the
subjunctive aiter quia implying the deceptive or unreal character of
their alleged quies. This pregnant construction is of frequent occur-
rence in Tacitus and not rara elsewhere. Cp. eg. Aer. 30, 28, frustra
. . . effnperis ‚· Hist. 1. 16, site bene eiepi (is I lione done nell in

bitae: justice arrd sair declina, taken up by boni neqniqne in chiastic
order. The plural predicate aiter two abstract noune joined by oc
(atque) is the rule in Tacitus, but the singular with et. Cp. note
Dial.b,18. The collocation oi these terms is common, cp. Dici. b,

20. nomina superioris sunt: ore nantes os the victor. cp. the
the phrase ntiphtisripbt. 1ta=naqna Cp. note ch. 2, 14.

Such ellipses are characteristic oi Tacitus Cp. ag. ch. 41, 20 ; Dici.

· 7‚3; 16, 14; Hist. lV. 26, and note Agr. 2, 7. vocantur: are

regarded as (po by tlte nante); the literal meaning would absurdly
imply that Tacitus had actually heard them so designated. For the
sentiment, cp. Sen. Epist. 45, 7, temeritas snb titulo fortitudinis latet,
moderatio vocatur ipnacic ,· de ira, lll. 41, 3, colpus animosa intratur
et audaces in bonore sunt, placidi pro inertibus habentur.

22. (sed) Chattis: adversative asyndeton. The victory alluded
ιο probably belongs ιο the year 83 an. See note 36, 22. 1οτ-
