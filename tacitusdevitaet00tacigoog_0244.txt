carucae aerenum. 157

au ‘s' So perhaps also 37, 22, taraus, sed for hamas et, as suggested
hy Halm.

31, 26. in patientiam bellaturi] inpoenitentium arma loturi-
Wex; inpoenitentium letari-MSS.-The emendation of Wea is by
far the simplest of the many suggested, and is highly satisfactory in
sense. 1 can see no force in Woelfflin's objection that the Britons had
already taken up arms, and could not, therefore, be said latam. Nor
can Ι understand why Tacitus (as F. ad loc. maintains) should have
shrunk from using a perfectly intelligible phrase like orma serre t'n
paenitentiam. Paenitentiam might of course be regarded as the false
solution of the compendium for patientiam, which, be it observed, .
is not found in the MSS.; but even if it were, the fo'rmer would be
the difficilior lectio, because a less commonplace, and therefore a
more 'faciteam antithesis to libertatem than patientiam. We shall
take up arms against the Romane, says Calgacus, in the hope of secur-
ing our liberty, and not in the expectation of having ever to regret
the attempt, as was the case with the Brigantes.

32, 9. alia: possibly this represents the compendium for aliena, a
reading highly suitable to the context, hut see note note ad loc.

33, l. virtute vestra] virtute et—MSS.-Peter alone of recent
editors has defended the traditional reading, but 1 cannot accept his
reasons. imperium Romanum does not merely'represent the substitu-
tion of an abstract for the concrete, but is clearly a personiiication used
to avoid the mention of Domitian, for the successes referred to belong
for the chief part in the reign of that emperor, Peter erroneously sup-
posing that the abstract was employed so as to include Vespasian,

Titus, and Domitian. The Empire once personified, it was as natural ’

as it was legitimate to predicate cirtae, or any other quality of it.
See also note ad loc. I have, therefore, had no hesitation in restoring
the reading of the MSS.

33, 9. montesve] montesque—Urlichs. The suggestion of an
alternative is quite out of place, the aim of the speaker being to give
a cumulative effect in the enumeration of the hardships the Roman
soldier had overoome. The collocation, pallidas montesque et fltnnino,
is, moreover, exceedingly common in Tacitus -vc -et‚ not being found
at all. cp: note ch. 12, 3.

33,]1. acies] veniant—Schoene3 animas-MSS. Damoclem
occurs only in Val. Flacc. V. 617, and should, therefore, not have been
forced upon T. veniant, though not a certain emendation, gives an
excellent sense and is methodically as justifiable as coiea.
