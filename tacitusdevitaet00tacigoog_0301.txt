277. The iant here stated is doubtless true, but the absence oi such
conrpromising correspondente was hardly due to the chastity 01
German women, but rather to the rarity oi writiug among them,
the practice not becoming more general among the Germane till the
loth century. Even Charles the Great could not write his own name.
Tacitus' desire 10 exalt the purity 01 Germanic society at the expense
oi Roman degeneracy has here tempted him to prove 100 much. Cp.

long hair was a sign oi noble birth or distinotion; cp. Langobardi and
criniti, an epithet 01 the old Franhish kings. ln the case 01 women
it was a highly prized possession, and 10 be deprived 01 11 was, there-
