sources. Thus no distinction is made between winter and summer
apparel (cp. note cb. 46, 13); nor is it reasonable to believe that Ger-
man garments presented such uniformity as is here implied, asuppo-
sition confirmed by numerous discrepancies in other writers, such as
Caesar, 1ο1 these cannot all have been due to actual changes intro·
duced between his time and that 01 the author to whom Tacitus owes
his information. .

Ohaptcr 18. The marriage customs oi the Germane, dealt with in
this and the following chapter, seem to have excited the genuine admi-
ration ο1 Tacitus, and in consequence the description is again stylisti-
oally elaborated, 01001010 ioreshadowed by laudaveris. This rhetorical
coloring is due chiefly to the following elemento: octaphoro (ll. 231,
30. 321. l 1. 33 19, 6 f. 13, 18 i. 19) ; chiasnaas (l. 22); epanalepsis

18. Quamquam: in spite 01 this, 101 the last clause might easily
have suggested laxity 01 morals. In rejecting this possible impression
as erroneous, Tacitus at thesaure time skiliully establisbcs a transition
to the discussion 01 marriage customs. Qnarnquoni in an independent
principal clause occurs in Tacitus only here, Dici. 28, 11; 33, 6; and
in one passage 01 the second part 01 theinnan (xinoa), in which
he often returnstohis earlier usage. ’

19. laudaveris: potential subjunctive. prope soli barba-
rorum: the Gauls and Iberians being among the exceptione which
Tacitus may hove had in mind. Concubinage 0001111, however, to
have been permitted.
