omnio Oceanus poet Oceanum altit. Tacitus held ιο the diskshaped
form oi the carth; cp. notes Agr. 12, 32. 1. The confident assertion,
etfama aera, may possibly be due ιο the information iurnlsbed by
Agricola’s circumnavigation oi Britain.

4. Ergo: ie. since the world is here at an end, I now turn to the
east oi the Baltio. suebtct maris: this designation ior the Baltio
occurs only here. Cp.notech.43,19,Saebio. Aestiorum gentes:
they belonged to the Baltosslavio group and are the aneestors oi the
old Prussiana Lithuanians, and Ietta. Their language, which ιο the
untrained ear oi tradere (for it is to them that Tacitus’ intormation is
ultimately to be traoed back) sounded lilre Celtic, would be alone suffi-
cient ιο stamp the Aestii as non-Germanio; but the fact that language
is one oi the principal criten'a oi ethnical differentiation is a com-
paratively modern discovery, and Taeitus’ error is, therefore, quite
excusabis.

⁵. Ηοεοο Britannicae propior: the British alands were con·
oeived as much nearer to these regions tb'an they are, and hence the
lingulatio relationship of some other Celtic tongue with that oi the
Aestii the more readily suggested itseli to unseientlfie observers who
had heard both spoken.

6. Matrem deum: i.e. cu. deorsum, as in Aac. IV. 64, opud oedem
Matris deuna. In all probability here the same as the Terre mater, or
Magno Mater Idaeo, mentioned oh. 40, 3, where see note. These culte
were clearly distinguished by the Romans, but the wearing oi animal
symbols by the devotces oi the Magna Mater and the similar practice
noted among the Aestii were sufficient ior the interpretatio Romana
to identiiy the two deities. ,

’1. termae aprorum gestant : the boat was a Germanic symbol oi
eourage. Cp. Beowuli 304, -

The boar’s likeness shown:
Over the visor, with gold adorned,
Brigbt and firebardened, the boar kept guard.

8. omnium: neuter. Cp. note oh. 39, 21.

9. Rarus . . . usus: this would be in keeping with the peace·
loving disposition oi the Aestii, attested, as late as the dth century, by
Cassiodorus, Ver. V. 2, pacatam hominum penae omnino.

10. frumenta ceterosque tructus: cereola aad other fraite o!
tlteflelrl. patientius: more etteryetrhally. pro solita Germ&
norum mertia: op. ch. 14, 24; 15, 6 ; 22, 27, and esp. 26, tuit.
