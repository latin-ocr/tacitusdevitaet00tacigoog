adopt its commonplace phraseology and appropriate its most

Pliny’s Natural History. -Tacitus' indebtedness to the
Natural History 01 1110 elder Pliny has been advocated with
no less confidence, and yet this assumption is also demon-
strably erroneous. Admitting, what is not improbable, that
Tacitus was acquainted with this encyclopaedia, it does not,
in the first place, seem plausible that he laboriously searched
all through so voluminous a compilation 101 details 10 be
utilizcd in his Germania ; 101, with the exception 01 a short
chapter in bk. IV, Pliny’s references 10 Germany are few,
incidental, and scattered over the thirty-sevenboohs. Now,
11 we examine the passages upon which the above convic-
1100 10 primarily based-they are but two in number,-
we find that these, on the contrary, affcrd thc clearest evi-
dence that the Natural History was not put under contri·
bution.

Thus Pliny (IV. 13, 28, 99 1.) divides all Germanic taces

1010 fiae large groups.1 Tacitus, cn the other hand, cites
only three, omitting the first and last, but mentions another
classification on the authority 01 older sources,² which added
the Vandili and three other tribes, one 01 which, the Suebi,
is given as a subditicios by Pliny, while 1110 other two are

omitted altogether. Again, the Suebi are clearly differem
tiated by Tacitus 11010 the Herminones, in flat contradiction
to Pliny. Finally, 01 the tribes enumerated by the latter,

1 Vanditi quorum pars Burgodiones, Varianae, Charini, Gaianas.
Alterum percus Inpaeucnea quorum pars Oirnhri Teutonico Chauco-
rum gentes. Iroairni autem Rheae Istiaeones, quarum pars Sagant-
bri. Mediterranei Hermiones, quantur Suebi, Hermunduri, Onatrr,
Cherusci. Quinta pars Peucini, Basternae.
