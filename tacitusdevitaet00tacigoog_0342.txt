explanatory of quieti secretique, the clariss 001110. . . populantur
referring to siue impotentia in chiostic order, as often in Tacitus, at
the close oi aperiod. For this post-augustan meaning of prouocare,

10. raptibus et latrociniis: so combined, Hiet. 1. 16; II. 58, per
latrocinia et raptus, 1011001010 being the narrower term. This state·
ment is contradicted by Tacitus himself in Aua. XI. 18, where he
speaks of wauton predatory raids oi the Chauci, uuila dissectione

sc. finitimorum uqros. Cp. note Aqr. 20,18.

11. virtutis sc virium: the same alliterative collocation occurs,
eg. Cic. de orat. 1127, 12.

12. ut superiores egent: their superioria, object of adsequuntur.

13. 111 res poseat: aiormulaic phrase. Cp. eg. 011. 44, 11 ; Diui.

posed to armo. The term is rarely applied to non-Roman forces (eg.
ch. 30, 3; 43, 3). Here it is in the nature of a compliment, quite in
keeping with the eulogistic tone of the chapter. Promptus est must
be supplied out of the preceding promptu.

14. plurimorum: here, as often in 'Tacitus used in its weakened
sense of ucrq 01000. Cp. note 011. 1, 9. virorum equorumque =
peditura equitumque, astereotyped phrase more usually in inverse
order, but, as here, eg. Hist. 11. 70 ς III. 25 and Cic. de off. lll. 33,

Ohapter 36. 16. cherusci: their great career in history began
with the cnrshing defeat oi Varus in the Teutoburg Forest in 9 01),
under their illustrious leader‚ Arminius to whom Tacitus has pald
a celebrated tribute in Anu. ll. 88, liberator houd dubie Ger-
maniae . . . 0100111100010000,1011000000οε. After his assassina-
tion in 19111, the Cherusci fell a prey to internecine feuds with the
Chatti. ln 84-5 aa. they had so far degenerated as to invoke the aid
of Domitian, who, however, only gave them money. After 'Tacitus'
time they disappear from history, their name figuring in later writers
only as a literary reminiscente. For their location, see map.

17. marcentem: enervatum, here used by metonymy‚ cause for
effect. So similarly Diui. 13, 17, sumam pellentem, where see note.
inlacessiti: a Tacitean word, occurring only here and Aqr. 2011.
