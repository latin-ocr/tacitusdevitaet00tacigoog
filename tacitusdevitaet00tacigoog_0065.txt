sidered, namely, Sallust and Livy. Both were held in high
esteem by Tacitus,¹ and Livy’s description of Britain was
demonstrably known to him, while Sallust served as his
model for historica] composition.ss There can, therefore, be
no doubt that he was not likely 1ο have ignored any-
thing these famous historiens had written concerning
Germany.

But that Sallust had given an account oi the tribes and
customs of Germany in an excursus of his Historias, usually
cited hy grammarians under the title of de situ Pontico, is
an arbitrary assumption which is in no way strengthened
by the incidente] mention oi the word Germani in two
isolated fragments.8

Livy-Livy, on the other hand, did deal at some length
with the geography and customs of Germany.4 But as his
sources can have been none other than Caesar and probably
Posidonius5 it were rash to assert, in the absence of all
definite clews, that Tacitus is directly indebted 1ο Livy; nor

has his style left any but faint impressions upon the later
historian⁶
