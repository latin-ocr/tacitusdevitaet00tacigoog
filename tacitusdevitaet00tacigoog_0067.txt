the friend and teacher of dicero, has only in recent times
been restored to honor. His influente, especially upon the
Romans, in many fields of human knowledge, has been
'incalculably profound and lasting. His Ἱστορίαι, in fifty-two
books, which began where Polybius left off and continued
the narrative to the time ci Sulla (ie. from 144 to c. 80 n.c.),
was extensivoly utilized by later writers, such as Livy,
Strab0, Diodorus Plutarch, and many others, the exhaustive
account of the wars with the Cimbri and Teutones, in par-
ticular, enjoying canonio authority. Distinguished by all
the graces oi style, his writings abonnded in elaborate dis-
cussions of a geographical, ethological, and ethnologicall
nat'ure, and he everywhere manifested a keen interest in
religious origins, mythology, and the development ci
society. With Tacitus he shared to a remarkable degree the
tendency to idealize the times and barbarian communities.
Thus the strikingly similar reflectione on the purity and

righteousness' of the Scythians, found eg. in Verg. Georp.
111.3rcff.; Hor. Ourna. ΠΙ. 24, 9 ff.; Justin. II. 2, are
demonstrably Posidonian. Livy, Caesar, and, above all,
Sallust, especially in his introductione to the Ontr'line and
,bipartita drank from the same fountain. Varr0, alec, in his
monumenta] work, entitled Antiqnt'tctes rerum lntntcacrnnt
et divinarum in fcrty-one books, Seneca, the poet Mani-

lius, and, as late as the fourth century, Ammianus Marcel-
linus, were all alike, though in varying degreeJ considerably
indebted to this Stoic savant.

1 The doctrine oi the influence oi elimate upon character is direotly
attributed to Posidonius by Galen. Thcugh he cannot be considered
its originator, the general familiarity with the idea in later writers is
probably due to him. lt is implied in Mela, 111. 3, 33, ut coeli as-
perioris ito irtpent'i (of the Sarmatians) and esp. in (lerna. 29, 13 i,
where see note. The sentiment in ch. 19, 22, has also a Posidonian
ssavor, as pointed out ad lcc.
