satisfactory accuracy. Now, a careful comparison between
the two authors, where they deal with the same or similar
topics, reveals the fact that there is but a single passage in
the Germania which can be said to betray the direct influ-
. ence of Caesar,¹ for tbe few other verbal coincidenaes² per·
tain to statements which would naturally be expressed in
but one way. Other items of information exhibit either
noteworthy dr'rerqences or amplificatione of so significant a
character as to preclude Caesar as the direct or even the ulti-
mate source of Tacitus on the subjecta in question. In fact,
the wealth of new details and the very nature of the mate·
rial in the Germania bear eloquent testimony to the advenae
made in the geographical and ethnological knowledge of
Germany since Caesar's time. Caesar, it cannot but be
admitted, had at best only a superficial acquaintance with
Germanic tribes, an acquaintance, mor-cover, acquired under
one-sided conditions, for their most characteristic customs,
ceremonias, and modes of life could only be observed in
times of peace. A considerable part of the information
which he furnished on these subjecta wne, therefore, nec-
essarily secured at second hand. Nay, it can even still
be shown that Caesar had himself occasionally consulted
earlier literarp sources³ which were, of course, equally
accessible tc Tacitus.
