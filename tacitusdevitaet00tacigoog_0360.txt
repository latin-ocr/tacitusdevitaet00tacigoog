25. muliebri ornatu: probably the priest was clad in a long robe
and wore thicker hair like women; at least the Haediaye, the narno oi
the Vandilian royal family, means men triti wentart's hair, and the
king, as inall primitive society, also exercised priestly iunctione. Cp.
note ch. 10, 10.

26. castorem Pollucemque: the worship oi the twin brothers,
or Dioscuri, is Indo-European, and the interpretatio Romana (or
, rather Graeca) is here not merely based upon accidental similarlties

27. Aleis ι probably dative, by way oi symmetry with reamini ,· cp.
ηοω ch. iti, 30, and critical Appendix, ch. 36, 29. With vccabulum,
however, we have the dative in ch. 34, 20. The name occurs only here,
and its etymology is indeterminable. Nulla simulacra: this is in
keeping with the statement in ch. 9, 2 ff. peregrinae supereti-
tionis ε ie. non-Germanic worship, the designation superstitio inpiy-
ing that this cult, unlike that oi Isis, was not regarded as having been
imported. Cp. ηοω ch. 9, 29 f. The entire passage shows that
Tacitus or his authorities while inclined to recognize the identity oi
the German and Roman deities, were sorely puzzled at not finding the
coemite evidence in support oi it, by which they elsewhere established
their mythologieal parallelisms.
