As regards the idealizatiou 01 Germanic traits and ous-
toms,¹ it must be observed, not only that it is at best inci-
dental, but that a similar attitude is shared by the ancients
generally, who from Homer down have thrown a halo 01111-

· nocenoe and rectitude about the remote people 01 the North,

101 distance 1100 always lent enchantment to the view aud
omue r’pcotum pro mapuifioo. Now to a man like Tacitus
who, dissatisfied with the conditions 111 which his lot was
cast, longed to dwell 111 the ‘good old times,' these sturdy,
vigorous Germans naturally came to serve as a welcome
background 101· his pessimistio reflecticns. The resultant
contrasts, so disparaging to the society 01 his day, were thus
partly the natural outcome 01 the subjeotmatter as such,
partly the reflectiou of those convictions and fecliugs which
give to all 01 the author's writings that distinotive character

and individuality which we designate as Taciteau.²

abandoned, another hypothesis, though without a 0011111110
