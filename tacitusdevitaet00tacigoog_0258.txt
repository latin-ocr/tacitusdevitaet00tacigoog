elon 34] novus. chariss 4. ill

cp. eg. Dici. 10, 15. iniectos: best taken in a good sense, not
tointed but changed. Cp. the meaning of conrumpere in ch. 23, 13.

6. propriam et sinceram: distinct und pure. Similarsynonymic
groups are frequent. Cp. ag. Diui. 28, 5, Hist. IV. 64, sinceras and
integram Suet. Any. 40, sincerus et taccat-aptus. The statement is
d‘oubtless exaggerated and due to the general tendency of the Greeks
and Romans to idealize the peoples of the north. Cp. Introd. p. lxiii.
et tantum arri similem: like only to itsols,· erit pencris. Tacitus is
fond of rounding off a polysyndeton or asyndeton by an amplifled
clause, et tonitam, ceteri, utullus being particularly often employed for
that purpose. calumanias. p. xvii.

’1. extltlmm urea to he. habitus . . . corporum: physico!
characteristica. So again, e.g. Aur. 11‚2.

8. quamquam . . . numero: ia spite os their ltayc multitude.
The Romans habitually overestimated the population of Germany.
With the ellipsis of the verb, cp. ch. 14, 313 18, 18. lt is particu-
larly frequent inTacitus with quamquam and quumvis.

9. truces et caenulei oculi: these and the following features of
the Germans are often alluded to in ancient writers. rutilae:
blond. Other epitheta applied to their hair are flavus, rusus, ouri·
comat, ξανθὸς, πυρρός, χρυσοειδής. magna corpora: cp. ch. 20, 24;
Aur. 11,3 ; Hist. V. 18; Caes. Β. (11. l. 30,1; IV. 1, 10. The Roman
soldiers seldom exceeded 5 feet 7 inches in height ; hence the con-
stant marvel at the huge frames of their German ioes. The statement
itself has been amply confirmed by the measurernents of skeletons‚
and even at the present day the inhabitants of northwest Germany
ara among the tallest men known, not excepting the Patagonians.

10. ad impetum ι sor artddea uttuck. They were impetuous‚ but
showed no endurance. The same observation is frequently made, eg.
Tac. Ana. Il. 14 ; corpus ut . . . ad breuem inunctum validum, sic nullu
uulnerum patiemim Seu. dc iro, Ι. 11, 31. laboris atque ope·
rum: The collocation is very common. 111 Tacitus again, Hist. Il.
10; V. 12; Aaou. Ι. 20; XI. 18. 011 the adversative asyndeton, cp.
Iatrod. p. lxvii. non eadem patientia: sc. quom expectamus cle
radonis corporibus, ie. their endurance does not correspond to their
powerful frames. The ellipsis is analogous to that after oeque
(Dici. 36, 4) and perinde (oh. ὃ, 23; Ayr. 10, 20).

11. tolerare. . . adsueverunt: with the former, supply adsue-
veruat; with the latter, tolerare. Such reciprocal ellipses are ex-
tremely rare and less bold than the present instance. 'Cp Catuli. 64,
