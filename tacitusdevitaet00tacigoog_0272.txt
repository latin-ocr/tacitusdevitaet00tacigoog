(see following note), but din proves that uidimus must be taken in a
general sense, tn our omn day me witnessed. Cp. Aer. 2, 6, cetus octos
vidlt; Cic. pro Mil. 28, 77, multos . . . victorius nostro cetos clota·
Liv. XXII. 14, 6, eom (sc. oront) . . . plenam hostibus. . . oide-
omus (we live ιο see).

23. Veledae: she belonged to the Bructeri and took a most promi-
nent part in the uprtsIng oi Civilis. She received ambesum, formed
alliances‚ and the most precious portione of tha booty Iell ιο her share.
Her power was at its helght when she correotly predicted the defeat ol
the Ronran arnry. On the downlall ol Civllls ln te Α.ο., she was
brought to Rome as a captive. Cp. Stat. Silo. Ι. 4, 60, and below.
plerosque: many. Cpnote cb.b,17. numnis loco: cp. Hist.
IV. 61, lule imperitabat (sc. Veleda), cetere opud Germanos more
plerosque seminarum sntldt'cns et capescente superstitione arbitrantur
deos (deos?); 65, eornm odire adloquique Veledam nepotum. Arce-
bnntnr adspectu qno uenerationis plus inesset. Ipso edito in turre,·
delectus eu propinquis consulto remensoque, nt internuntius numinis
portabat.

24. et olim. . . venerati sunt, ete: this passage corresponds to
the statement, uetere . . . fatidicos, just cited, and probably refers back
to the time of Drusus (6 ο.ο.). See below. The quasideification of
Veleda, on the other hand, lurnishes an illustratlon oi ertpescente . . .
deos. The contradiction, therefore, with which Tacitus is here gen-
erally charged, does not exist. Albrunam: the name is purely
conjectural, and the etymology usually given (⁴endowed with
prophetIc power') mere guesswork arrd accepted only because· it
happens to be in keeping with the context. Whether the person hers
mentioned by Tacitus is identioal with the barbarian woman ol super-
humen siue, who ln Latin speech forbade Drusus to advenae any
further, is possible, but not certaIn. cp. Suet. Claud. 13 Dio Cass.
LV. I. complens allas: eg. the Ohottn muller, mentlonedabove
(l. 21); Gerana, a prophetase among the Senrnones ln the tIme oi
Domitian (Dio Cass. LXVII. t). The LongobaIdIan Gornboro and
the Alemannian Tlllotn belong to the utu century. Complures occurs

iu Tacitus only here and Hist. II. 43 V. 22, plures being uised ·

Instead. epaonense.

25. venerati: esteemed lllyltlm clo homope to. In thIs neukened
sense the verb is quite common in Tacitus, eg. Apr. 46, 19 ; Ann.
VI. 6. Iacerent dees: as they did later in the case oi Veleda (see
above). There Is possibly also a satirical side-glauco at the deification
