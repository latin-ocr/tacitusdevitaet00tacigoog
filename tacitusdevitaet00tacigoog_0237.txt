150 Ἴ sorus. suerrus 45. [rien 31

This matchless epilogue (oh. 45, 2511), so iuli oi pierciug tenderuess
aud solemn eloquence, is in its reflections to a large extent made up of
well-known and often recurring rhetorical commonplaces, but such
is the consummate art oi Tacitus that he has nevertheless breatheda
new originality into horrowed material, and at the same time suo-
needed in creating the indelihle impression of a spontaneous and
deeply sincere cutburst oi sorrow and affection. See also Iatrod.
p. xix.

2⁷. constans et libens: totth concrepa und cteeryulucss.

28. latum excepisti: Tacitus has some thirty phrases ior death
and dying, he being fond oi working variatious upon commonplace
expressions. Cp. in this trectise, ch. 1,14; 2,16; 3,19.24; ὃ, 3;
7,8;16,27;16,32;29,2;31,17;38,21;41,25;42,5;43,29.9;

Epist. 76, 23, tamquam . . . donares: the tamquam clause,
giving the inierence oi others (l. 27), according to Tacitean usage,
on which see note ch. 16, 19, is based more particularly upon libeas,
ior a man such as Agricola must be assumed to have met death
constans, even if there had been no suspicion of foul play. That he
should by his manner have given the impressicn of exonerating Domi-
tian would be quite in accord with his character, as drawn in this
treatise. pro virili portione: apparently a new coinage to avoid
the hackneyed pro cirili porte (not in Tacitus). The phrase occurs
also fflst. ill. 20, but is generally very rare. Op. Introd. p. xxv.

30. erepti: the use oi a perfect passive participle ior an abstract
noun is characteristic oi Tacitean style. Oi the nearly thirty iu-
stanoes, however, it is iound in the smaller works only here and
Dtol. 29, 22 ; 37, 27.
