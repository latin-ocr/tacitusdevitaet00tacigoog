STYLE AND amomo.

Tacitus is not only the greatest historian whom Rome
produced, but he is also one oi the greatest stylistic artists
in the world's literature.

Equipped with the most thorough rhetorical training
which his time afforded (and without such, it must be remem-
bered, no ancient author, least of all in the postAugustan
age, could hope lor recognition or an abiding renown),
Tacitus began his career as a writer with the brilliant
Dialoyas dc oratori-bas. This exhibits the youthiul author
still completely under the spell oi the exuberant diction of
(licere, a return to whose style Quintilian, Tacitus's great
toacher, advocated with liielong enthusiasm, to offset the
corrupting influence oi Seneca. Nearly twenty years were
to elapse before Tacitus brohe the silence imposed by the
despotism oi Domitian with the publication oi the Agricola.
The great difference which conirouts us in the style of the
two treatises is easily accounted ior, but only one of the
causes¹ calls ior special mention here. The exigencies of
artistic prose imperatiwely demanded a distinctly different
treatment ior each species of literary composition, a his-
tory, an encomium, a speech, or a letter exhibiting a stylis-
tic type peculiarly distinct. Now, when Tacitus designed
the Agricola, he conformed to existing rhetorical canons ior
the βασιλικὸς λόγος, 01· biographical eulogy, as we have seen,
but forits stylistic irameworh he selected as his model
the historiam Sallust² And certainly Sallust’s ‘immortal
swiitness,' his epigrammatio directness and general sty-

auctor, with which estimato Martial, Tacitus's contemporary, fully
agrees. Cp. Bk. XIV. 191, Primus Rooaaao Crispirs ia historia.
