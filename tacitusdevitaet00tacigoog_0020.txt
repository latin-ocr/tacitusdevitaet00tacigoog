order is definitely fixed only for the first, the second, and
the last; iu the arrangement of the others certain preferences
are expressed, but otherwise considerable latitudo is allowed.
N o rhetorically trained writer seems to have ventured to

the theme itself‚ in the circumstances under which he
wrote, and in the purpose he had in view.

Now acomparison between these rhetorical precept's and
illustratione and the Agricola reveals the fact that Tacitus,
as far as possible, followed similar models.

or precise rules for the introductiou to the βασιλικὸς λόγος
