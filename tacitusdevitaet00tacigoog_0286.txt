Praese] nonus cuninae 13. 199

solemn investitura with the shield and spaar, in later times the swerd,
was an aot 01 0111010110οω0111, entitling the youth to active member-
ship in the civil and military organizaticn 01 the 0101100. Tacitus
himself compares the act 10 the Roman ceremony oi the assumption
01 the toga 0111110, the correspondente is, however, only partial.

82. moris sc. 001, so often in Tacitus for the more usual nvos
est. Cp. note Apr. 33, 25. In this treatise again, ch. 21, 23. aul-
ieoturum probaverit: shall adiunge bina to be one ubo would ,11000
equal to bearing arnis. For the absolute use oi sufficere, cp. Anu.
Ι. 13. Probacerit cannot be taken as the perfect subjunctive, 101 this
would call 101 sufficere or suffecisse.

Pago 39. The following paragraphs (ch. 13, 1-14011.) deal with
the peculiarly Germanic institution 01 the comitatus which is a
conspicuous tecture in all Teutonis cpias, as eg. the Nibelungenlied
and the Beowuli, and 01 which the leuda] system of the Middle Ages
is the ultimate outcome. It must have made a deep impression upon
our author, as is evident from the detailed description and the more
elevated diction in which the informationis clothed, the most note-
worthy rhetorical elementa here accumulated being the following:
libration os clauses (1121, 91, 14, 23), antuniana (ll. 21, 11, 14,
181, 291.) ; asyndetic antithesis (ll. 31, 121. ; 14, 181.,03) ; poetical
or rare incutiens (ll. 3. 7; 14. 22. 27. 29. 30. 32. 2), suiuess os
’ expression (11.6. 141. , 14, 20. 21. 24. 3) , edicamus (l. 16; 14, 281, 2.) ,
0111101011υο antithesis (14, 3).

1. propinqui: e. g. 11 the iathar was no longer living.

2. haec. . . toga, hio . . . honos: observa the attraction 01 the
pronoun. So belen, l. ll, and see note ch. 7, ll.

3. hoc: ie. 011110 sumere. domne para . . . mox rel
publicae: theu appear as part os tbe samita, subsequently they be-
tony in ι00110100 to tbe state. The expression is ambiguous through
over-concisenesS, 101 the German youth did not pass out 01 the putria
potestas till his marriage. Hence, in translating, pars must either be
taken ἀπὸ κοινοῦ, 01 else we* must suppose the ellipsis 01 tantuna . . .
etiam. Reipublicae, 01 a non-Roman community, is found in Tacitus
only here and Ann. IV. 43; XIV. 27.

4. sut magna patrum merita: i.e. where the ancestcrs were not
nobiles, although the insignis stabilitas would naturally include in

many cases the alternative here mentioned. Aut = or euen; cp. note
ch. 6, 11.
