NOTES TO
THE GERMANIA.

Pago 32. Ohapter 1. 1. Germania omnis: (1111111111 ia 111
entirely, but exclusive of Germania superior and insertor, on the leit
bank of the Rhine (ior these were Romanized provinces), and oi the
so-called aori decorantes. See map. For a similarly loose use of
11111111, cp. Caes. B. G. Ι. 1, Gallia 11111111, where the Roman (11111111
Narbo-aeaeis is ignored ior the same reason. Raetisque et Pan-
nonas ι- que combines the two Danubioa natione, joined into a group
by 111, to the Gallie tribea living along the liniue. Noricum, which
intervenes between Raetia and Pannonia, is here omitted ior the sake
oi stylistic symmetry. The ethnology of the 1111111, who occupied the
modern Tyrol, eastern Switzerland‚ and part of Ravana, is still involved
in obscurity. Their language bore some resemblance to the Etruscan,
and they probably belonged to a racc which preceded the great Indo·
European migration. Pannoniis: a people oi Illyrian stock, which
survives in the modern Albaniana.

2. Rheno et Danuvio: the names are probably Celtic, meaning
the waning and the rapta. Ister, the more usual designation ior
the lower Danube, never occurs in Tacitus, Sarmatia: virtually
identical with the Scythians3 but here more particularly the Iazyges
Sarmatae are meant. Togather with the Daci, they occupied the entire
eastern boundaries oi Germany. See map. Dicis: the same as
the Getae, among whom the banished poet Ovid lived. They had
often vanquished Roman armies bnt were finally subdued by Trajan
in 107 nn, nine years aiter the date oi this treatise. They were
driven out oi their ancestral abodes hythe Iazyges in the reign oi
Claudius (41-53 x.n.). mutuo metu aut montibus: the colloca-
tion oi an abstract and a concrete expression, here emphasized by
alliteration‚ 1s ΜΨ common in Tacitus. Cp. ch. 7, 13; 43, 3, “
andIairod. to Ayr. p. xxxiv. The phrase was imitated by Mlmm
