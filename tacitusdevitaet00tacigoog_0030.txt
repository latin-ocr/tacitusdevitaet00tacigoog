inferences have long since been recognized as unwarranted,
but it is only recently that Tacitus has been fully vindi·
cated. The unexpected avenger appeared in the shape of

the following, apparently insignificant inscription, discov— ,

Ἀσιανοὶ ἀνθυπάτῳ Κορνηλίῳ Τακίτῳ, io Cornelius Tacitus the
proconsul. Thus Hoffmann's indictment only remains as
a warning illustration of the aberratione to which au over·
subtle ingenuity may lead.

That the Agricola does contain a politioal creed or con-
fession of faith is clear from many passages3 indeed, the
very preface vibratas with indignation at the memory of
the reign of terror. No doubt an unmeasured denunciation
of Domitian's rule would have been received with favor.
Instead, Tacitus determined to write the life oi a man who
had lived through this hated regime without either becom-

ingan abettor of Domitian's crimes or his obedient tool,
but, on the contrary, showed, in Tacitus's fine phrase, posse ,

practiced moderation and did not call down upon themselves
by futile opposition the wrath of the emperor.2 That Agric-

the hidden purpose of exonerating him (and by implicatior
his biographer) in the eyes of those who were now raging
against all who had belonged to Domitian's official family and

trary, the political atmosphere, so to speak, which pervadas
