known Latin euphemiam, 1110 absolute use 01 the verb, however, 10
very rare—A few instanees are recorded in later times, eg. Dexippus,
a Vandal king, killed 0 dos 101 violating 0 treaty, and 011οἀ00001
slew a soldier who angered him 01 0 military review. Caes. B. G. VI.
23, 4, in only apparent contradiction 10 Tacitus, expressly attributes the
power over 1110 and death to maqtstratus qui 01 bello praesint, 101110
seems to make 0 distinction between the magistratus 00 0 body and
the 0111101000 acting as individuale. .

3. ¹verberare :v in strong contrest with Roman oust0m‚ which per-
mitted even centurions to inflict corporal punishment upon soldiers.
Cp. Aac. 1. 23. This was considered so degrading to a German 1100-
men as to involve the loss 01 his civic rights. sacerdotibus: this
is also 01 varianae with Caes. B. 11. VI. 21,1, raeque 11111111001011001
qut rebus 11101010 praesunt aeque sacrificiis studeat, but the passage
only denies the existence 01 0 religious caste 01 priesthood‚ not that
01 priests altogether. Resides, Tacitus may on the 0110 hand have
been in possession 01 better sources 01 1010111011011, while Caesar‘s
statement may have been applicable 10 but 0 single tribe. The
remaining alternative, 11101 conditione had undergone 0 change in the
interval, is less probable.

6. Effigies: these are 110οςοε 01 animale sacred to different deities,
1110 Germane having no idols (oh. 9, 2). Thus Woden was worshipped
