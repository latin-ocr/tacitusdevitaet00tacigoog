rari rraraeram, penae serratilc. opere: eg. in the ergastulum,
the pistrinam or molae traeatilee (troad-mille), or in quarries, the most
dreaded punishment oi all. The three modes bere mentioned are enu-
merated in Plaut. Menaecb. V. 6, 9 (vs. 974) cerbero, compedes, molae.

6. non disciplina et severitate: aot sor tlte purpose os eiciet ‹iis-
cipline. Hendiadye, as shown by Dici. 29, 28, Hist. Ι. 51, severitate
disciplinae. The collocation occure repeatedly, cp. note Dial. 28, 17.
lt 'is here used ιο balance impeta et ira = tapeta irae, ia aa oatbaret
os rope. This latter wae, however, given ae the motive ior the murder
oi aslave on the part oi a nobleman oi the tribe oi the Heruli, in the
btb century, recorded hy Agathiae, ll. 7. impetu et ira: the chol-
eric temperament oi the Germane ie repeatedly remarked upon hythe
ancients, eg. Veli. Pet. ll. 118, Mela, Ill. 3, 26, inrnaaee sawt animis.

7. nIei quod impune eet: ie. in case he killed bis own slave; ii
nothis own, he bad to make restitution, the valae, according to the
Salio Lavr, being that oi ahorse crox. Liberti, etc. : according to
ancient German documenta, the liti could acquire property and could
claim Werpeld which was, however, lower than that oi the free-born
or iapeaai. But complete manumission, which was a public ceremqny,
seems in later times not to have been granted except among the Lorn-
barde, Franks, and Scandinavians.

8. momentum: scaram ῥοπή, accoaot,iquaeace. ln Tacitus,oi
persone only here and Hist. I. 595 and, with the exception oi this
passage, combined with prande, once with magnam. The figure le

taken from the scale, and oi common occurrence in English. cp. 1

shakespeare, Halala, ‘Mattere oi great pith and moment'
9. numquam ln civitate: contrasted with conditione at Rome,

where liberti, especially under Caligula, Claudius, and Nero, were
frequently the real power behind the throne. cp. note Dial. 7, 7;

Hiet. I. 76; Aac. xr1.54; Seu. de tranq. 8, 1. dumtaxat: only.
'ibe word does not occur elsewhere in Tacitus.

10. regnantur: βασιλεύονται, are culed by tinas. Genuine kingly
rule was rare among the Germane and confined to the lese important
tribes. Cp. ch. 44, 7; 45, 30; Aac. XIII. 54, ia quantam Germani
regnantur. The kings oi the Marcomanni and Quadi (cb. 42, 7) con-
stitute only an apparent exception, as they ruled on Roman sufferance,
cp. notas cb. 7, 29; 10, 20. The passive use oi the verb is Vergilian,
eg. Aea Ill. 14, but frequent later. Ibi, eta: this statement in
ite generalization is very questionable and probably again due to some
extent to the desire ior a rhetorical close. et . . . et = oca solator
