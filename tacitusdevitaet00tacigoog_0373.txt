23. rem difficillimam adsecuti sunt: cp. Api. 4, 21, retinuitque,
quod est difficillimum, eu supientia modum. illis ne voto quidem

. opus esset: according to Socrates, to desire little is divine, but he

who desires least isnearest to the godhead. These hali-human sev-
ages have, however, gone even beyond this. Tacitus in his rhetori-
cal flight has here reached tho grotesque. Op, however, J ustin Il.
2, 9, ol the Scythicus, boec coutinentia iliis morum quoque iustitium
edidit nihil alienum concupiscentibus, quippe ibidem diuitiarum cupido
esi, ubi ei usus . . . boc iliis naturum dure quod Graeci loupu sapien·

que mores incultae burburiue conlatione superari. iunio plus iu iliis

24. catenulam fabulosa: ull abusionibus ou belongs io legend,
implying that the preceding statements were, in 'l'acitus’ judgment,
satisfactorily authentis. Hellusios: Plin. N. H. IV. 14, 27, 96,
probably mentions the same people underthe name Hilieviones, but he
places them in scandinavia. Oxibuas: the MSS. have different
readings, such as Eiiouus, which is preferred by some 3 but neither
name occurs elsewhere.

25. ors, etc: the imagination oi the ancients peopled these un·
known regions with many similar monsters‚ and even as late as Adam
oi Bremen, we learn oi men with eanine 'heads on their brensts, oi
canuibals, Amazona, and giants. Norse mythology is significantly iull
oi like creaturas. It is, however, quite possible that the particular iaci
hers reported may have been based upon the impression which men
covered with the skins oi wild beasts made upon Roman observers. A
similar statement Is iound in Tac. Anu. 11. 24, unibipnus bominum
et beluarum surmus, and the ui incompertum, etc, implies that he
was not quite prepared to reject these reports aa impossible.

26. in medium relinquam: Aulus Gellius (N. A. XVII. 2,11)
says that iu medio was themora common, bnt that the accusative is
probabilius sipuiiicuuiiusqua it being used on the analogy oi the Greek
θεῖναι ἐς μέσον.
