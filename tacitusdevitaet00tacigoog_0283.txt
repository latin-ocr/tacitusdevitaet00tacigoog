18. poenarum: death pernities. See below diversitas supplicii.
Other crimes, though not belonging to leuiora delicte and not punished
by death, are here ignored, Tacitus having iu mind only those eom-
mittedagainst the eommunity as such. ex delicto: in proportior to
116616666166661116666666. Proditores 61 translegas: these terme

· and desertor are naturally eiten combined, eg. Hist. Ι. 12; 1v. 68;

Α66. II. 10; IV. 48. They are not synonymous, transfugiant and
desertio being 61166 only distinct manifestatione ol proditio. It has
frequently been maintained that Tacitus bas here been inconsistent
with his statements in oh. 6, 26, and 14, 20, eonoerning 1116 iniamy
attaching to desertare, but he is there speaking only oi men who would
he beyond 1116 redet os tbe loro. Desertion, like other acts oi 1666666,

an overt aet oi cowardice and may include deserters who were caught
in the attempt. According to Norse law, the ooward in battle could
be killed on the spot.

20. corpore inlames: 1116111666616166616161616666666611611 are
emphaslzed by polysyndeton and alliteration, the last member being
amplified. Cp. Introd. p. lxvii. The same phrase occurs in Ana. Ι. 13,
and refers to nnnatural vices, 611 instance being recorded among the
