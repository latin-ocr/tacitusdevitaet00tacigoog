PREFAOE
TO THE GERMANIA.

Tun literature which has accumulated about this immortal
treatise is well-nigh overwhelming‚ my own bibliography, though
probably far from exhaustive, filling about fourteen printed l}

peges. Under these circumstances there can be but little room

for originality, and the chief taslr oi an editor of a book oi this

nature will primarily oonsist in a careful siiting and an exten·

sive condensation oi the exegetica] material furnished by gen-

erations of German scholar·s; for, with the possible exception of

r Fustel de Coulanges, no others seem hitherto to have contributed

anything oi real value to the elucidation of the Germania. But

in spite of this fact, there still remain not a few passages which

have in my judgment been uniformly misinterpreted, scholare being

’ eomewhat reluctant to recognize an are nesciendi, or prone to read

into the treatise oi Tacitus what they strongly felt ought to be

there. In all these instances, as well as in many others in which

traditional views seemed to me unwarranted‚1have‚even at the

’ risk of incurring the charge of presumption, not hesitated to give

my own conclusions‚ although the scope and aim oi this edition
preoluded their detailed justification.

Itis, of course, quite impossible to enumerate all the scholare
to whom 1 am under obligations, and Ι can, therefore, in this
place mention only those works to which I am specially indebted
throughout. Of more recent commutarim, I have always had
before me those oi Baumstarh, Muellenhoff (Deutsche Alterth,
Vol. IV.), Schweizer·Sidler, Zernial²‚ Il. Wolff, and Furneaux. I
have also constantly consulted the works oi Zeuss Grimm, waitz,
Mnch, Golther, Baumstarlr’s Urdectsche Alterth, Wackernagel,
and Muellenhoff, D. molal-111. Such monographs‚ disserta-
