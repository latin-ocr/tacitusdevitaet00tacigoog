deliberately selected so briefl and ludicrously inadequate
a paragraph as this for imitation is like maintainiug that
, aKiepert or a Mommsen consulted a school geography
or history. There ie, moreover, very little in this chapter
to correspond to the account of Tacitus, the similar items
of information being of the most eommonplace character
and partly found in Caesar.

Under these circumstances, it is quite superfluous to
discuss at any length the alleged stylistic influence of Mela
upon Tacitus Suffice it to say that the verbal coincidenoes
so zealously collected,² either do not pertain to the same
topice or were unavoidable, many expressions belonging to
the common vocabulary of the language, while in others
the resemblance is imaginary or, at best, extremely faint³
Finally, as these fancied reminiscences are culled from all
the three books of Mela, and not, as oue would expect, from
the chapter on Germany alone, it would logically follow that
one of the greatest stylistic artists in the world's literature

lFully one-hall oi it is, moreover, taken up with a bald enumera-
tion of the foreste, swamps, and rivers of Germany, together with a
description of the riuus Codanus in which scandinavia is supposed to
belocated.
