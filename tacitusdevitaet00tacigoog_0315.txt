³1. 00 quoque, etc: this is afanciful explanation 01 Tacitus,
prompted, as usual, by the desire to give a rhetorical 01 epigram-
matic close 1ο a chapter. In consequence, he has involved himself in
incongruities ; 101, as fidene shows, the loser'svoluntary servitude would
not have been considered a disgrace, while the winner's action cannot
