30. testimonium: memorio could not have been used with proe-
sentium bonorum, because the still uncompleted reign 01 Traian was
included among these. But, when the Historiae had been published‚
their author had dccided 10 reserva the record oi Nerra's and Trajan's

2. procuratorem caesarum: the procurators were officers in the
imperial household‚ appointed by, and solely responsible to, the ern·
paror. These positione were originally held by ireedmen and equites
aliha, but as the administrativa iunctione 01 the emperor extended,
the higher and more responsible procuratorships were given only 10
knights, who were then generally distinguished from the minor ‘pro-
curatores' aa procuratores Augusti. (laesurum happens to be found

equestris nobilitas: these offices had become one 01 11ιο marks of
an equestrian career, for men 01 senatorial ra'nlr were dcbarred froin
holding a procuratorship. The expression itself, fn place of ordo
equestris, seems not to occur elsewhere, and is here used in the same
technicel sense which Tacitus repeatediy gives 10 equites inlustres or
insigues, namely, knights occupying high positions. The exact equiv-
alent, equites nobiles, Is also found, eg. Liv. XXIII. 46, 12.
