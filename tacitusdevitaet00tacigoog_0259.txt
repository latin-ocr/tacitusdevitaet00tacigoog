Peleo; and perhaps Tac. Hist. 1. 3, supremae clarorum necessitates
(sc. sortiter toleratae) ipse (sc. necessitas) sortiter tolerata. The
fact itseli is frequently attested. Op. Hist. ΙΙ. 93, Plut. Mar. 26,
and esp. Polyaen. VIII. 10, 3, Μάριος Κιμβρὶους ἠπίστατο κρύος μὲν
καὶ χὶονα φέρειν δυναμένους, καῦμα δὲ rol dissentientis. Wherever‚
asin Appian, De reb. dcii. 3, the opposite is asserted, we have an
instance oi the idealization oi northern peoples referred to above.

12. ingere atque lnediam: here not balanced with sitim ces-
tnntqna to avoid the accumulation oi pne, but contrasted by chins-
mus. On the ellipsis of sed, sec Introd. p. lxvii. caelo soloque: by
reason os their climate. The ablatives are causei. The collocation
is very common, eg. ch. 29, 14; Agr.- 24; Hist. V. 7. Observe the
skiliul transition, ior the mention oi solo naturally suggests the land
and its products, terre being placed at the beginning oi the next

The most famous of these primeva] sorests are the Hercynian, Bacenis

14. horrida . . . foeda: the former refers to the impression

15. ventosior: we expect some word like aridior to eontrast with
umidior, but the cause is put 101 the effect, the southern highlands oi
Germania being rendered drier by the winde sweeping over them.
adspicit: with the metaplior, cp. Aur. 24, 3.

16. satis ferax: prudentiae os cereola, especially oats, barley,
and ilar. 'l‘he ablative with serus is Vergilian‚ eg. (1001011. 322,
feros oleo. Elsewhere Tacitus has the genitive, eg. Ann. IV. 72.
