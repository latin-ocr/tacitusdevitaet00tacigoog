have been awkward. pulsis olim Bolis: io. 60 aa. Tacitus is
generally supposed to have been in error here, as the Marcomani had
at that time not yet migrated 110111 their ancestral scats ; but had the
author meant to imply this, he would have joined olim with uirtute
parta. Cp. also note 01128, 12. Who the occupants 01 the iomrer
Boian territory were is not known; possibly some remnants 01 the
Cimbri, who had driven out the Boii.

4. parta: sc. est. On the chiasmus 01 the predicates at the begin·
-ning and end, cp. note ch. 19, 6. Quadive degenerant: sc. a
uirtute Marcomanorum, as is not surprising in view 01 their probable
kinship. Oi their prowess, Amm. Mare. xxix. 6. 1, perhaps with
reference to the period spoken 01 by Tacitae,'says: Quadorum natio
pamm caune (lth century) senaidanda, scd· inmensum parantum
antchac bellatrix ct potens. In the 5111 century they joined the Van-
dals and founded a new kingdom in Spain, which was subsequently
destroyed by the Visigoths. anue. . . velut irons: ttcsc somn

provinces. anue stands hy attraction ior tique. Cp. note oh.

5. praecingitur: is yirdlcd, scirtari sc. Germania. So eg. Plin.

7. reges: e. g. Vannius, the probable successor 01 Tuderor 'Iudrus
gente . . . genus: the singular seems to point 10 the close tribal
relationship of the Marcomani and Quadi. Maroboduus : aiter the
collapse 01 his Suebic confederacy in 18 nn, he took refuge with
Tiberius, who kept him 111 honorable confinement at Ravenna,
where he died in 36 nn. Cp. Tac. Ana. II. 45 f. (121, where his power
101 hermis compared by Tiberius with that oi Philip 01 Macedon,
Pyrrhus, and Antiochus the Great.

8. 'l'iidriz astho context shows, the founder ol a Quadiandynasty.
His name is mentioned only here. lam et exterum patiuntur:
this seems to imply that when the Germania was written their line
had become extinct. The kings mentioned by Amm. Marc. XVII. 12,
21, probably belonged 10 a different dynasty. The statement itseli is
confirmed by later inscriptions, and the practice was in accordanee
withan established Romanpolicy. Cp. Agr. 14, o ff. vls et
potentie: on the distinction 01 these and similar terme, very ire-
quently combined, see notes Dial. 5, 13; 19, 12.

9. Raro armis nucula: no instance oi such an armed intervention
isrecorded.
