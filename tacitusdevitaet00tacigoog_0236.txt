111130] 1101110. enarras 45. 149

Pliny and Senecio 101 malieasance in the government oi Hispania.
The trial resulted in his conviction, but the sentence was not carried
out.

17. nostrae . . . manus: i.e. 01 senators, including Tacitus,
cp. Plin. IX. 13, 2, 111 senatu senator senatori . . . 11101100 intulisset,
where the trial 01 Helvidius is narrated at length. Helvidium:
son 01 Helvidius Priscus (on whom cp. note ch. 2, 18), consutili 111.
Ηο was accused oi lese maieste and executed. The date 01 his death
. is fixed by this passage, i.e. shortly aiter August 23, 98 an.

18. Maurici: Iunius 1110011000, brother 01 Rusticus, whose exe-
cution is referred to in ch. 2, 11, an intimate friend and correspondent
oi Pliny the Younger, and highly esteemed by Nerva and Traian. In
10111. he requested Vespasian 10 submit to the senate the names 01
all informers found in the imperial records. Cp. Tac. Hier. IV. 40.
110 was banished by Domitian, but recalled by Nerva. visum sc.
foedavit, to be supplied by zeugma 011101 perfudit, and this the more
easily, because 1101101110 10 011011 joined with both these verbs. Le. us
the sight 01 Mauricus, sent into exile, and 01 liusticus, led 10010011-
tion, has polluted; us Senecio besprinkled with his innocent blood.

19. Senecio: 0001010011. 2, 18. tamen: 10. despite his 011101
disposition. subtraxit oculos: the phrase, found also Ana 111. 53;
XVI. 26, and its analogue, subtrahere auree, seems to be Tacitean.

21. videre: sc. eum. adspici: sc. ab 00.

22. subscriberentur: ie. the ever-present iniormers would
record our very sighs to be made to testiiy against us on some
future occasion. denotandis: to moire triental 110ιο os. On the
final gerundive, see note ch. 23, 23; with sufficere, as here, ag. Aac.
III. 12, and Quint. I. 9, 3.

23. palloribus: abstract 101 concrete, cp. note 011. 16, 21. Here
perhaps influenced by rubor, with which it seems intentionally con·
trasted. -Domitian's very look sufficed to drive the blood irem many
aiace, which would 1101 escape the delatores. vultus et rubor:
1111111110 raddy gluto. This is attested by Tac. Hist. lV. 403 Plin.
Peneo. 48; Suet Dom. 18, though different and less disparaging
reasons 101 11 were occasionally given.

24. contra pudorem muniebat: his ruddy complexion did not
allow a blush 01 shame, which his atrocities should have called 101111,
10 bosean or recognized as such. The passage seems slightly incon-
sistent with ch. 42, 14, nec arribuit. With the statement itseli, cp.
sen. Epist. ll, 3.
