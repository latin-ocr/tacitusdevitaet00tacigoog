4. 11111111 peninsulas with winding shores. For this meaning, ep.
ch. 37, 26, and Plin. NH. IV. 1, 1 (01 Greece). insularum:
scandinavia and the islands on the Danish and Trisian coasts, 111 the
former was down to the early Middle Ages invariably regarded as an
island. inmensa ε although Tacitus, under the influence 11 Vergil,
is fond 11 using inmensas, enormis, ingens and the like in the 111111-
ened sense 11 1111111111 (cp. ch. 31, 22 ; Agr. 10, 13), the word is here,

ΙΙ. 67, 67, 167, seem, however, to leave no doubt that Tacitus here
alludes more particularly to the expedition 11 Drusus in 12 n.e., when
thc Romans 1111111 first time came within sight 11 the Danish coast.

was often wrongly identified with the Gotthard in connection with
the source 11 1111111111111 river.
