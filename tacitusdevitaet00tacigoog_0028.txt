writer, however fresh his sorrow or pungent his grief, never
forgot that he was primarily an artist and hence, while col·

lecting such consolatcry commonplaces as seemed called
for, he, at the same time, spared no effert in presenting
thern in stylistically elaborated form. Now the marvelous
achievcmcnt of Tacitus consiste in this. Although many of
the pathetic sentiments in the closing paragraph are merc
rhetorical τόποι,1 hohas, nevertheless, succecded in creating
an indelible impression of genuine sorrow, affection, and
deep sincerity.

We, therefore, conclude that the Agricola of Tacitus is
exactly what its author says it was -a euloglstic biography,
constructed, as we have seen, on fairly orthodox rhetorical
lines, more particularly in accord with the detailed rules
governing the βασιλικὸς λόγος, preserved in Menander’s περὶ
ἐπιδεικτικῶν, which, though of a late date, merely reflecte
orthodox, scholastic traditione. Butthese, in their suh
stance, far autedate the time of Tacitus himself.

THE PURPOSE OF THE marcore.

Wholly distinct from the discussion of the structural
character of the Agricola, though habitually confounded
with it, is the controversy which has been raised regarding
its real purpose. TacituS, it is true, has here also expressly
