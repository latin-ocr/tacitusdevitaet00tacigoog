142 nores enarres 43. [ries as

or violent death, but jaina in its present sense oi an unenviable dis-
tinction 01· notoriety is generally common. ι

23. seniis, etc: this famous passage, admirable alike in expres-
sion alid, ina-the sonoronsness ci its stately rhythm, not only sounds
the very keynote 01 Agricola's political convictione and liielong prac-
tiee, but it also embodies the principles by which Tacitus himself was
guided in his own career, as is evident from the numerous passages in
which he inculcates the same opportunistie and temporiaing doctrines.
Cp. eg. Aca. Vl.10 (16) 01 L. Pis0, quotieas necessitas ingrueret,
sapienter moderans. inlicita: disioyalty.

24. posse . . . esse: a favorite collocation 01 Tacitus. Op. eg.
ch. inspicientium . . . effugisse. magnas vlrds esse. . . in-
claruerint: observa the fine effect oi these two most iavered ci
rhythmioal clausulae, giving a sonorous finish to weighty sentiments
Cp. note ch. 30, 12.

25. industria ac vigor adsint: on the plural predicate with two
abstract nouns joined by oe, see note ch. 4', 21.

26. plerique = plorimi, the classical signification, but very rare
in Tacitus. cp. note ch. 1,10. per abrupta: sc. ascendentes, i.e.
the maiority who lack the qualities just mentioned and injudicionsly

, rebel against authority may, indeed, also reaoh great renown, but they

do so over perilous paths, their effort culminating, without any ulti·
mate benefit to their country, in a sensational death. Tacitus does
not believe in politioal ma1·tyrd0m,if it is not likely to bring about
the realization oi the obiects fought ior. Cp. Ana. IV. 203 XIV. 12,
sibi causam periculi fecit (sc. Thrasea), ceteris libertatis initiam aaa
praebuit.

Ohapter 43. 29. Finis, etc. ι this opening paragraph closely re-
sembles Clade arat. III. 2, 8, suit boa (so. mors Crassi) iocinerum
sciscendum patriae, grave bonis omnibus. It is a rhetorical τόπος,
prescribed ior the epilogus. Op. Introd. pp. xviiii.

30. extraneis: oatsiders; in Tacitus again, Ana. IV. 11, 01 one
not related. -aobis-omicis- estraaeis-iynotis, mark a descend-
ing climart. stiam. . . que n0n=et ae quidem. So again in
Tao. Aac. Xlll. 35 XVI. 22, qnoque-aon being frequently thus
used. ignotisque: aad aot evea io those eota taeta liniaci. In
this active sense, ior ignaras, the word is rare, but found eg. in Nae-

vius, Cicero, Nepos and occasionally in post-Augustan Latin. ln T.
again, Atta. Il. 71. vulgus . . . populus: the collocation is ire-
