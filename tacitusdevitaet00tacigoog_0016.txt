proconsul 01 Asia, as we learn 110111 011 inscription.¹ The
date 01 his death is altogether unknown, but it cannot have
been earlier than 116 A.D., as may be inferred 110111 an allu-
sion to the conquests 01 Trajan.2

Writiugs.—Ii we except the youthful but brilliant Diu·
ioguo and numerous speeches which the distinguished orator
doubtless published from time 10 time, according 10 the
prevailing custom, Tacitus's illustrious career as a writer
begins with 1110 Apra'coiu, which appeared shortly after the
death 01 Nerva (Jan. 27, 98 an), although the entire work,
with the exception 01 the prooemium (1-3) and one passage
11111100100011111)1 well have been composed immediately
after the death 01 Domitian.

In the same year there followed 1110 Germania, the date
being fixed by eh. 37, 5 ff. 01 that work.

The Historias, announced as in contemplation in the Agra·-
cola (ch. 3, 28-30), appeared between 105-109. They com·
prised the story 01 1110 reigns 01 Galba, Otho, Vitellius,
Vespasian, Titus, and Domitian, but only the first four
books and a fragment 01 the fifth, dealing with the year
69-70, have survived.

The Arsacis began with the death 01 Augustus, and con·
eluded with the assassination 01 Nero in 68 A.1›. Only
bks. I.-IV., portions 01 V. and VI, and bks. X1.-XVI‚ are
preserved, the entire narrative 01 the reign 01 Caligula,
the beginning 01 that 01 Claudius, and the end 01 Nero's
being lost.

2Απη. II. 61; IV. 4.

³011. 44, 4-11 has all the appearance 01 an afterthought‚ it being in
the nature 01 a vaticinium post eventum, and ch. 45, 12, aon 11111,
etc, it seems, would very appropriately have followed immediately
after potest . . . effugisse. The absence 01 the epithet dicus in
ch. 3, 13 need 1101 imply that Nerva was still living when these words
werepenned. Seenoteadloc.
