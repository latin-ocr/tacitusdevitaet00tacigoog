Peos 33] NOTES. CHAPTER 2.

a confirnratory remark oi Tacitus. 11 esse were to be supplied, cera,
by the side oi crtfirnaant, would be tautological.

11. ceterum: burt be this os n may, in any case. On this frequent
resumptive force oi the particle, see ch. 9, l; 25, 32; 43, 28 ; and note
ιο Diui. ⁸26, 6. The following indirect discourse shows that Tacitus
here returns to his authorities, who, contrary ιο the traditional view,
cannot be the qnidam· lor, in the absence of all evidence to the con-
trary, there is no reason to believe that there was any differeuce oi
opinion concerning the statement in this closing paragraph. Note
also that a quidone, according to the mode oi citation customary
among the ancients, need not refer to more than one author. recens
et nuper auditum is opposed to antiquo nomino. On the clastic
signification oi nuper, see note Diui. 9, 18. llere it refers back to
Caesar, a period· oi about 150 years or possibly to the time of the
Slave War (vs-71 no).

12. qui primi, etc. ε cp. Caes, B. G. ΙΙ. 4, l, plerosque Belqus esse
ortos ab Germanis, Rhenumque antiquitus traductos. . . rot couse-
disse‚ Gallosque . . . captusne-iu, Oonrlrusos, Eburones, Oneroesos,
Poemonos qui reno nomine Gernscni conpellantur.

14. ita nationis, etc: thus the stasne osu tribe, not os ο roae,
yrrrduully qoined the upper hund, in thot ott uere collect Germani by
the uictor sor the purpose os insptrtnq scor; subsequently they called
themselves by the invented nome; ic. 'l'eutonic tribes crossed the Rhine
and subdued the Celtic peoples bordering on it. In order to inspira
the conquered with fear they represented all the Transrhenish tribes
to be their brethren, who would be ready to aid thern, il necessary.
Subsequently the victors assumed the very name which they had
devised ior a specific purpose. The phenonrenon itseli has numerous
analogias. Thus Graeci and Hellenes were originally small tribes
dwelling in Epirus and Thessaly. Cp. also the Trench Allemund ior
German, derived irom the Allenranni, and-Deutsch itsell froin the
Teutones. Notio is usually the narrower term, qens the wider ; but
this distinction is nowhere consistently observed, the context determin-
ing its specific meaning. Ita: ior itaque, which in Tacitus occurs
only in three passages oi the Dialogus

15. omnes: i.e. all the tribes still remaining behind on the right
bank oi the lthirre, such as the Eburones, eto, mentioned by Caesar
l.c. They subsequently came to be merged in the Tungri. The
invaders may well have been the Belyoe. ob metumr sc. inicien-
dum. Ob. denoting purpose, is frequent in Tacitus. cp. Tac. Hist.
