36, 14. aequa . . . aegre, etc.]†oequc . . . tceyre. This
emendation of the corrupt text gives a good sense, but it is ,more than
doubtful, if it represents what Tacitus wrote.

37,19. vacui spernebant] (vacui) spernebant. nocui I believe
tc be a gloss on panace expertes, which taken by itself is ambiguous.
In any case, the fact that these Britons were vacui cannot have been
given as the reason why they despised the small number of the
Romane.

37, 1. fitam] identidem-Humor.

37, 6. perscrutari] persultare—Rhenanus. See F. ad loc.

3819. consilia (aliqua)] consilio alicae-MSS. See note and
F. adloc.

38, 23. deserti] secreti -MSs See note ad loc. and Purser l.c.
p. 198.

38, 30. peditem atque equites] pedites utque equites. See
0. R. 329.

38,2ἰ. proximo anno. . . redituraerat] proximo . . . redie-
rot- Ms's. Cp. Andresen and F. ad loc.
¹ 39, 6. excepit: this reading may be defendedasinnoteadloc,
but accepit would be preferable. The codex B (Δ) has only coepit,
and the two verbs are frequently confused in MSS. cp. my note to
Diol. 1, 14 (p. 60 edit. maior).

41, 27. vigorem ct constantiam et expertum . . . animum]
rigorem, constantiam et, etc. — Α (Γ). This reading, though hitherto
universally rejected, accords with the consistent practice of Tacitus in
the use of et after an asyndeton, the third member being amplified and
adding a new and often, as here, the most important clement in the
enumeration. cp. Hist. 1.15 (cited in note ch. 41,17) and Introd.
p. xxvrn.

41, 28. eorum quibus exercitus committi solerent, quibus]
ceterorum quibua - Grotius; eorum ortibus - MSS.

42, 13. preces excusantis] preces se accusantis. cp. note ad loc.

43, b. adfirmare ut ausim] quod (Acidalius) firmare (Henrich-
sen, Woelfflin). The ad is a corruption of qd, the lower part of ‘ q’
having become obliterated. The use of the simple verb is quite
Tacitean. Cp. eg. Arra. I. 81, de comitiis . . . uic qrrldqaam firotcre
cresim VI. 28, perae uetus oternorv'o firmavit.

43, 7 f. libertorum primi et medicorum intimi: ae totitatis
the standing epithet of liberti in Tacitus, one is strongly tempted to
read vvith Ernesti, medicorum primi et libertorum intimi or simply
