x INTRODUCTION. ΙΙ.

Biography, according to all our ancient authorities, be
longe to the epideictic branch of literary composition, in
particular the encomium, and its rules are illustratori, as
was natural, in connection with the biography of a king, ’
the socalled βασιλικὸς λόγος,1 the rhetoricians usually citing
astypical models the still extant Agesilaus of Xenophon and
the Euagorae of Isocrates.² That the Agricola partakes of
the character of an encomium, amerely cursory perusal could
have confirmed, even if Tacitus had not expressly told us so
himself.³ Iu fact, the line of demereation between a his·
torical narrative and an encomium was a very slight one.⁴

The constituent parts of a regularly constructed encomium

Ι are the following:⁵ 1. προοίμιον. 2. γένεσις, φύσις, ἀνατροφή.

These precepts present a stereotyped sameness, being often reproduced
verbatim from earlier handbooks, and they are, one and all, ulti-
mately derived from trectises reaching back of our era. The Romans
developed no rhetorical systems oi their own, but began in the days
oi Cicero and thereaiter with ever-increasing assiduity to copy and
follow the rhetorical canone of the Greeks. For a brief account oi
the above rhetoricians and others, see Christ, Griecbiscte litteratur-
geschichte 8, pp. 762 ff.

1 That its essential features are common to biographical writing in
general might have been taken for granted, even if Menander (libet.
Graec. 111. 369, 26 Sp. IX. 216 f. W.) had not expressly confirmd it:
οὐ γὰρ ἴδιον τοῦτο μόνον τοῦ βασιλέως τὸ hucimor, ἀλλὰ κοινὸν πρὸς

, πάντας τούς οἰκοῦντας τὴν πόλιν.
