st’s edition of the Agricola (1852) may be said to constitute
a new laridmarlr in the philological labors devoted to the elucida-
tion of this biography. Hs incorporated what was still ol value
in the work oi his numerous predecessore, and added nota little
of his own to the improvement oi the text and toa better under·

to the criticism and exegesis oi the A yricolo, and to Tacitus gen·
erally, have been very considerable, both iu quality and quantity,

under the restrictions necessarily imposed upon a college edition,
all noteworthy rhetorical features in the style and structure oi the
Agricola, the synopsis in the Introduction being, for the reason
given above, intentionally more full than might otherwise appear
warranted in au edition of this nature. The discovery that Taci-

extant classical biographiss, as it will doubtless be to others. Ι
hope, however, that the necessarily brief review of the evidence
given in the Introduction will suffice to carry conviction.

In the Notes Ι have endeavored to iace every real difficulty and
to omit no comment, wherever such would be welcome to the
young student, and 1 trust that no wholly irrelevant matter has
