grounds. For not only is the insertion of crebrae eruptiones between
intrepida biems and et sibi quisque praesidio paleographically unwar-
ranted, bnt it also involves a flagrant violation of the Tacitean usage
of et after an asyndeton, and at the same time rudely separatas two
statements which clearly belong together.

22, 21. et erat ut] et ct erat—Hearichsen. This emendation,
independently suggested also by Purser, lc. p. 192, is extremely easy
and satisfactory, while at crat of the MSS. or ct erct ut is awkward
and ambiguous, referring equally to what precedes and to what fol-
lows. But Tacitus would certainly not affirm the charge involved iu
acerbior. With Henrichsen's reading, he qualifies the statement in
two ways. Agricola was not acerbos, but at best only iniucundus,
and even that only aduersus matos, foy he was habitually cornis bonis.

23, 25. percucurrerat] percurrerat-Bm), Woelfflin. Tacitus
seems to have avoided the reduplicated forms in compounds.

24, 32. nave prima transgressus: crossing over with a fleet for
the first time. The conjectures made to this passage are without
exception unwarranted. See O. a. 328 and notes ad loc.

24, 10. diffenmt: interiora parum, melius aditus . . . cog-
niti] 'differunt <in melius). Aditus . . . cogniti-Wex. Halm’s
interpolation of interiora parcre, apart from its boldness,attributes
to Tacitus a most gratuitous statement. In metica is probably the
marginal note or interlinear gloss oi some patriotic Irish scribe which
subsequently intruded into the text. The MS. tradition of the Apric-
οἱα being distinct from the other worlrs of Tacitus, and the contente
of this particular chapter appealing, as it must have done, directly to
Irishmen, lends color to the supposition that the archetypon came
from one oi the famous Irish scriptoria. Scribes have often relieved
their feelings by marginal remarks of this nature.

25, 21. timebantur] timebat—bitter, timebant-MSS. Agricola
is the subject throughout (incohabat, amplexus, exploravit). There
is, therefore, no reason for writing timebantur, particularly as timebat
is an equally simple correction. Agricola feared that the march of
altoman army might be rendered dangerous by the presence of the
nativas through whose territory they bad to pass.

26, ll. et Romanis: l should prefer to read ct with Baehrens.

28, 9. uno renavigante] ano retro remigante. cp. O. R. 329.
The Mss. read arto remigante, which is admittedly corrupt.

29, 24. Probably Tacitus wrote tulit, scd (set) for tulit ct, a case
oi haplography, the final ‘t' (of tulit) being, ae often, mistalren for
