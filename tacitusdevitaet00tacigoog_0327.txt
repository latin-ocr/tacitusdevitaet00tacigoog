nic in Callias conmiyroveriat (ch. 22, 3). Batavi: their immi·
gration into what is the modern Holland (see map) took place before
the time of Caesar, ior he already found them on the ismaelo Rheni,
called Vacalus (B. G. IV. 10,1). They are describedby Tac. Hist.
IV. 12, where the cause of their departure (seditione domestica pulsia),
as well as the statement that they were a branch of the Chatti, is
reiterated. The truth oi this relatiouship has been unjustly called
into question. It is in a measure confirmed by the alliance which
they subsequently formed, under Civilis 70 nn, with the Chatti and
Mattiaci against the Romans. The Batavians were especially noted
for their horsemanship and their skill in swimming. They were oi
huge stature and their hair was a pronounoed blond. The imperial
bodyguard was preferably recruited from them.

2. multum ex ripa: this construction is' a post-Augustam usage
ior the partitive genitive. Cp. Stat. Silo. I. praes, and in Tacitus
again, ch. 46, 6; Arra. ΙΙΙ. 18; XV. 68.

5. flerent: were destined to become. On this iinai subjunctive,
cp. note Ayr. ch. 34, t. Manet: aad ia scot, there remeans. See

term, defines docos more closely; hence also the singular predicate,

populi Romani on inscriptions,

6. nec tributis contemnuntur: the humiliating payment oi
tribute is given as a proci oi the non-Germanic origin oi the Osi (ch.
43, 15). nec publicanus adierit: sc. ecs; the tac sooner does
aot erdod them dorca by exacting vectigalia.

7. oneribus: the ordinary bardans os enantion. On the subjective “
dative, cp. note ch. 3, 30, and on the ellipsis of igitar (and thas), see
Introd. p. lxix. conlationibus: extraordiacry taces, i.e. nominally
voluntary contributione on special occasions, which often worked great
hardships. Cp. Plin. Pan. 41, conlationes remisisse (sc. Traianum).
et tantum: the last clause oi the polysyndetic enumeration is ampli-
fied and often introduced by et tantum, here with chiasmus. Cp.
Introd. p. lxvii. in usum proeliorum ε they fumished some ten
