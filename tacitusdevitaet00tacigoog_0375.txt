hesitation in making the change in accordante with the consistent
usage of Tacitus, on which see Iatrod. p. lxviii. Tht two conjunctione
arc habitually confounded in our MSS.; soeg. ch. 7, 13.

5, 30. Argentum quoque] Argenta'lnqae—H. Schiitz. And be-
sides, mercarer, is a frequent meaning ot initial -qae If qaoque were
correct, eeqeaatar quoqne argentam, etc, would have been called ior.
Quoque and -qnc are also repeatedly confused in our MSS. Op. eg.
Dial. ch. 22, 32, locosque ior locos qaoqae; 34, 25, bodie qaoque ior
hodieque ,· Liv. Ι. 11, 19 ; XL. 12, 10.

8, 24. Albrunam] ldibrnnom. The name is hopelessly cor-
rupted in our MSS, the generally accepted emendation ot Wacker-
nagel being based upon a purely conjectural etymology. See also
note ad loc.

9, 30. liburnae] liburnicae. See PH. p. 30 t.

10, 10. consultetur] metaliter-Walch ; consuletur—MSS.
See note ad loc.

10, 22. sed apud proceres: sacerdotes enim] ap. sed a. a,
se enirn. Halm, Controverse Stellee, etc, in Berichte der Miinclr.
Alcod. 1864, p. 30, suggested the transposition ot aed. It is omitted
before opud proceres in all but two MSS, one oi these being oi no
authority. The particle was doubtless written above the line in the
archetype, and hence some scribes inserted it in the wrong place,
the great majority overlooking it altogether. Se enim, on the other
hand, is found in all the MSS. See also note ad loc.

10, 25. explorant] explorantur—B3 explorator—AN. The
passive plural seems to me preferable. Similar variants, owing to
abbreviatione oi the endings, are excecdingly common in MSS. In
this treatise, e. g. the following readings, oh. 6, 12, (1010190001οη 27,
25, obserentem 44, 7, regnant ; 45, 30, defferretur, are untenable.

11, 1. praetractsntur] pertractentur-MSS, except CD2V. The
error was due to the abbreviation pr. cp. PH. p. 40.

11, 9. turba] turbae -Mss The conjecture oi Gronovius,
though accepted by many, is rendered impossible by the contextos
the preceding clause. Ut tardae placuit is but another sitium ea
libertate. li this hypothetical chairman could have called the great
assembly to order (for with turba placuit we must supply praesidi)
whenever he saw what appeared to him a sufficiently large number to
constitute a ‘quorum' the phrase nec ut iasar· conveniant would
involve a contradiction.

11, ll. princeps] princepae—Perizonius. Cp. PH. p. 40.
