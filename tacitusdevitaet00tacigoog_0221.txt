wasa peculiarly imperial characteristic, to which a mere subject
ought never to lay claim, for its possession involved an eminence too
exalted to be overlooked, besides suggesting odious comparisons with
an emperor so lacking in this very quality as Domitian. -0n the
predicative position oi the attributive, see Iatrod. p. xxv.

16. exercitus: mrocpltt cp by such reflectione. quodque. . .
erat: in apposition with the following clause.

17. secreto suo satiatus: i.e. having iully indulged in his char-
acteristic secret broodings over this matter. —Note the alliteration. —
With the statement itseli, cp. Plin. Pcrzep. 48, inmanissima bellac
