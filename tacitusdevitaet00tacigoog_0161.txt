4. priores: particularly Livy and Fabius Rusticus, and possibly
Posidonius, but uot Caesar, to whom eloquentia percoluere would be
inapplicable. percoluere: leuve erudelitated. In this sense the '
verb seems to bo ἅπ. eta, but cp. Plaut. Poeu. l. 2, 22 (vs. 232), uisi
perculta est (so. mulier) in a non-figurative meaning.

5. notitia: informetur, the word implying a more or less super-
ficial knowledge, as contrasted with scientio.
