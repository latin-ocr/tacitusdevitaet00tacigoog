itis, therefore, equivalent to aeque scelte, not: facilius ,· but this
involves an irreconcilable contradiction with ch. 37, l. 24. (4) It is
psychologically incredible that a man of Tacitus’ rank, insight, and
disposition should have seriously advised his countrymen that the beat
way to subdue their old enemy would be to start a beer brewery, with
aview to dispenslng the German beverage free of cost, and in unlimited
quantities, implying at the same time that the Germane would gladly
have accepted it, as not being supplied,a1ready with quantam con-
cupiscunt, asurmise flatly contradicted by ch. 22. Moreover, this
grotesque and absurdly impractlcable schema constitutes the only
policy which the great historian ventured to suggest in the entire
treatise -a treatise which many scholare, albeit erroneously, regard
aa a political pamphlet, prinrarily designed for Trajan and directed
against Roman jingoes! (b) Finally the pointed phrase, haud . . .
vincentur, is, quite unlike the numerous other epigrarnmatic expressions
of this author, not only utterly inappropriate, because demonstrably
false, but it also bears a suspicions resemblance to «lustin l. 8, 7, prins
Scythae ebrtetate qaam bello vincuntur, where the sentiment is, how-
ever, in perfect keeping with the context and not open to any of the
objections above referred to, but Tacitus was not in the habit of
borrowing epigrama or ol misapplying those of others. The entire
passage is clearly a marginal note ol some ancient reader which sub
sequently waa tagged on to the close ot the chapter, and it was written
at a time when triumphati magis qaam victi (ch. 37, 24) had ceased
to be applicable to the Germane, i.e. about the oth century an.

25, 32. ceteris] Ceteram-Wolff. To the reasons given by W.
for his emendation, we may add that utantur is incompatible with
ceteris, tor the serat condicionis huius, with which it is contrasted,
were not used at cll by the Germana, either in Germanorum or
Romanorum morem.

25, 32. discriptis] descrtptia- MSS. No reliance can be placed
upon the MSS. in the orthography of compounds with dl or de, but
describere arlaisteria officia, res, and the like seems to have been the
standard usage.

25, 4. Ch. 15, 8 f. 20, 24 ft, render it extremely doubtful whether
children, ie. before the fifteenth year, when they were invested with
arms (cp. ch. 13, 31 ff), would be called upon to do housebold duties.
1 am, therefore, strongly inclined to believe that Tacitus wrote liberti.
This would also at once account for the statement made immediately
below, liberti non milituln supra seruos anat, tor Tacitus had pre·
