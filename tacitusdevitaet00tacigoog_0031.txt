TAcITUS’s SOURCES OF INFORMATION.

That the son-in-law of Agricola was in possession 011

career goes without saying. And for the events and data
subsequent to Agricola's departure for Britain, Tacitus

lips 01 Agricola himself, although heis cited directly as
a source but three times (chs. 4, 15. 24,13,anu 44, 7).
Again, many items 01 information would naturally come to
his knowledge as being a contemporary; still others were
probably transmitted to him by some who were with Agric-

during which the author was absent from Rome, he could
also rely upon trustworthy oral testimony furnished to him
on his return.

assumption of a distinctly literory source are contained in
the survey of the earlier predecessors of Agricola and their
military campaigns. What this was cannot be determined.

narratives were at his disposal is shown by tho full account
given of some of these events, such as the uprising under
Boudicca (ch. 15 1.), 11 his Arcadia

The description of the battle at Mt. Graupius, barring a
certain historical backgronnrl, and particularly the speeches
