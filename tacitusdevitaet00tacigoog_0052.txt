this hypothetioal oraving. The'alleged opportuneness 01 the
publication 01 the troatise is purely accidental. Tacitus, as
he tells us himself, had writtennothing throughout the reign
01 Domitian (Agr. 3, 2611). When, with the death 01 the
cruel despotin 96 an, it again became possible, to use
his own words, sentire qnae celis et quoe sentias dicere, he
also ventured 10 break the silence to which be had been
condemned so long, and there appeared in rapid succession
the noble biography 01 his father-in-law, Agricola, and our

But even 11 the conclusione just refuted were less arbitrary

it is impossible to understand why every indication 01 its
character should be so absolutely wanting. We know but
little, it is true, 01 this species 01 literature among the
Romans, but, though extensively resorted to in the last days
