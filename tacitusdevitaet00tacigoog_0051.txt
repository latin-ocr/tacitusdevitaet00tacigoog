Briefly stated, their eontention is this: The demonicis

¹ a politicnl pamphlet, written as a kind of code mecum for the
emperor Trajan and in opposition to a poweriul jingo party

in Rome which, it is alleged, clamored for a progressive

t policy and vigorous offensive mensures against the Germana.
TraJ'an, who had now for two years been occupied with re

storing order and discipline among the Rhenish legions, and
had been actively engaged in fortifying the frontier line
against Germanic aggression, received the news of his suc
cession to the throne sometime in 98 ara, buthe did not
return to the city till 99 an. All eyes were turned to the
north, all Rome was on the qni cicc, so we are told, as to the
ultimate outcome of the emperor's activity. This condition
of suspense naturally awakened renewed interest in the
history, origin, customs, prowess, etc, of Rome's inveterate
but still unconquered locs. The appearance in 98 an. of
the Germanic of Tacitus was, therefore, singularly well-
timed, and, composed as it was, by a distinguished states-
man¹ whose consular term of office had just expired, the
treatise must have created something of a sensation and,
proved an effective weapon in the hands of the supporters
of Trajan's alleged defensive policy.

In this entire argumentation, everything is pure assump
tion. There is no evidence of the existence of an expansion-
ist party, none that the Romans at this particular time
craved for enlightenment and instruction as to the character,
customs, and location of Germanic tribes, especially as they

tion ago, have only recently (lece-1900) been published as vol. IV. of
his monumental work, the Dentsehe Altcrelrr‘lmer. See esp. pp. 11-17.

lIt is interesting to observe how the advocates of this theory never
fail to speak of the statesmon Tacitus, although he was at the time
known to fame only as an orator, nor have we any evidence that
would have entitled him to that designation at any other period in his
career.
