neaux‘s edition, Closs. Recieec, XIII. (1899), p. 213. The item of the
MSS, changed by Rhenanus into lte, which, ii the original, would .
hardly have been thus corrupted, seems tc bo nothing more than a
dittography of the final letters ol frontem. The confusion of et, ut,
ct is notoriously frequent, while the ellipsis oi sed in an adversative
asyndeton Is characteristically Tacitean. Cp. Iatrod. p. xxxi.

Ulcae. Rea. XII. (1898), p. 355, to read etiem for eciem, though paleo-
graphieally very easy, involves a ilat contradiction oi the context,
whether we take etiem in the sense cf evea or of also, as is evident
from lei. . . sepcct‘ssinti and pecc. . . deprehensi serat.

36, 10. equitum turmae: the explanation given in the note ad
loc, lieel convinced, disposes oi the many difficulties to which this
passage has given rise, without altering the text, although it is possi-
ble that equitnm merely represents aialse sclutIon oi the compendium
intended ior epeorvna. Thero were no equites among the Caledonians ;
on the other hand, the phrase cannot bc applied to the Romans without
making the entire paragraph hopelessly uninteIIIgible3 bnt inasmuch
as turmae equitnm was a well-known technical term ior a detaohment
oi Roman cavalry, nothing was more natural than that the scribe
oi the 'archetypon understood equitem with tarntee. But this word Is
frequently used oi a crowd or horde oi animals, and I so interpret it
in thIs passage, whether we actually read epactam or regard eqni-
tum in this sense as one oi Tacitus’s many Vergilian reminiscences.
F. Haverfleld (Closs. Rev. XIII. p. 305) in a very recent redxamina
tion oi the fiee passages, generally cited ior the use of eques = equae,
has denied the validity oi this equation. Hts argumentation dces not
appear convincing tc me, nor dc Ι see why epaee may not have been
employed in the analogously ambiguous sense that horse Is 'm English,
and ceeallere'e in Italian. Cp. also Milton, P. L. Ι, 307, chiceley =
knights. In any case, the present passage, though hitherto overlooked,
lnrnishes a very clear instance oi this confusion, every other interpre-
tahon involeng insuperable difficulties,
