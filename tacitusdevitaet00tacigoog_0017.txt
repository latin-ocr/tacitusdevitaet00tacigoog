viii INTRODUCTION. 11.

His design of writing the history of Augustus¹ and ol
Nerva and Trajan² seems to have been frustkated by his
death; at least no such works existed iu the time of St.
J erome (fourth century).

II.
m usuum ennuchum 01⁴* rmt AGRICOLA.⁸

The opening chapter of the introduction deals exclusively
with the biographical and autobiographical treatises of
former times, the Agricola being expressly designated asa
etta defuncti hominis at its close. Two other instanoes of
biography are added at the beginning of the second chapter,
and in the epilogue the biographical character of his work
is again emphasized hythe author.⁴ But in spite oi these
explicit statements, modern scholars have persisteutly re-
fused to accept Tacitus's own classifioation of this work,
on the ground that the treatise flagrantly violates certain
alleged canons of biographical composition, which must, of
course, either have been unknown to Tacitus or deliberately
ignored by him. But when the problem arose of assigning
to ita more suitable designatione great diversity oi opinion
was revealed, partly due to an habitual confusion with the
question as to the purpose of the treatise. Elimiuating
this for the present from the discussion as irrelevant, we
find that the principal objections against the assumption
that the Ayrtcolc is a hioprcphy res'olve themselves into two.
