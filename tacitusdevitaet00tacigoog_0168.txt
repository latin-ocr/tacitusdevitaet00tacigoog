or edge oi the disk-shaped earth. -The phenomenon oi the mid-
night sun is here given expressly on the authority oi others (adfirmant)
and, as a matter oi fact, itis not observed in even the urost northerly
regions oi Caledonia ln cerm. 45, 21, itis more accurately ascribed
to Norway.

Pege 9. 1. Scilicet, etc: thie ianciful and somewhat obscure
explanation was adopted by Tacitus irem some earlier end unknown
pseudo-scientim. It implies the belief, generally rejected even in an· ,
tiquity, that the earth wasa circulor shield or concavo disk, the sun's
shedow being supposed to cause night. On the presumably western,
unobstructed edge (11111111 11 plana terraram) the shadow cast would
below, falling tar beneath the heaven with its stars; at the center the
more extended curvature oi the suriece would projeci 11 to a somewhat
greater height, thus bringing on deeper darkness, while at the opposite
extremity there would be no shadow at all, or perpetual dayiight.
extrem et plana: except in Sallust such substantivei adjectivae are
icund in pre-Tacitean prose only il they convey a partitive meaning.

2. caelum et sidera: on this collocation, see Iatrod. p. xxx.

3. praeter: ecceptirtc, acomparatively rare usage. In Tac. again:
Hoc. V. 8, 10; Aac. 1. 13; XIII. 19, 45. oleam vitemque et
cetera. . . sueta: every frequent collocation in Tacitus, -111, join-
ing a group‚ followed by an independent clement with et. In this

Ι treatise again, ch. 25, 24.

4. terris: the eblative oi place where, though extremely common
in Tacitus, is still rare in the minor writings. Cp. eg. ch. 25, 24;
33, 22; 45, 3; Dici. 13, 21. oriri sueta: so Sall. Hiat. srcpm. l, 9.
hugum petiens, iocundum: 111111111111111 1111111111 fraite,
excepting such as grew only in warmer climates, like that oi ltaly. -
secontiam is added 11111111111111111111111)1 potiens, which is at best
a vagae term and therefore liable to convey 1 false impression. —With
the phrase, cp. eg. Lucan, IX. 857, impatiensque solam Ocrcrt'e.

5. tarde mitescunt, cito proveniunt: an adversative, not an
enumerative asyndeton which would involve en uncalled for hysteron
proteron. So exactly ch. 3, 19. -procent'eat cannot here signify
crocino up, 1111111111 (its usual meaning, with fruces and the like), for
this would be incompatible with tarde mitescant ; but it is used in the
very rere sense of comico forth, sproctiap, eg. Plaut. capt. II. 1, 26
(vs. 223) ; Tac. Hist. IV. 65.

7. Fert . . . argentum: confirmed by Strabo IV. 5, 2. Both gold
