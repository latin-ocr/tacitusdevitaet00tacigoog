viously, according to the traditional text, said nothing about liberti,
but had spoken only oi semi.

25,11. ceteros seems to have been assimilated to itnpcres, for
we expect ceteros, sc. pentes quae repnentur.

26,15. The correct reading can no longer be determined with
confidence. I believe that the corruption arose out oi inter ee t'n
cicesecundum, the scribe having by an oversight written ieter ee for
its less common equivalent in 111οᾶ011), but notieing his error, he, in
order not to spoil the page, wrote the correct reading after it, -a very
frequent practice3 or else bt eice was an old variant ior ieter se and
was accidentally inserted aiter universis, where it yields no sense.
Some such process oi corruption seems to me iar more plausible than
the assumption that io vices is a dittography ol universis, or that it
represents an original vicis (villages).

28,11. Helvetii, ulteriora Boii] Helvetii citeriora, citeriora
Boii. Mbller, in Zeitsclr. s. deutsches Alterth. vol. XXXVIII. p. 26,
inserted citeriora before Helvetii, which emendatIon was paleographi-
cally improved upon by Woelfflin, ibid. Angeiper, p. 207.

30, 21 f. chatti: inItlum . . . incohatur] Chatti initium . . .
incohent—MSS. with the exception oi A.

30, 23. durant siquidem] durantes quidem, ie. while tlte hilis
do, indeed, continue, they, etc. This seems to me a simplet ernenda-
tion oi the MSS. than any ol the numerous suggestions to remedy the
passage which have hitherto been made. Zdohbauer in Serta Hor-
tellone, pp. 241 ff. (1896), reads curantisque (sc. sedis) dum. ThIs
conjecture is also simple, but quite unacceptable, because of the in-
tolerable hyperbaton, unprecedented even in T.; nor does he elsewhere
join a participle to a noun, as the governing verb oi a ditm clause.

30, 7. parere] parcre-MSS. Cp. ch. 14, 4, eartyuioe percre;
24, 22, artem paravtt; Dici. 34, 121, sarnam . . . parari,·36,12;
Aba. II. 143 and frequently elsewhere in Tacitus. There is, there-
fore, no necessity ior disearding the MSS, although victoriam perere
is a stereotyped phrase. Cp. Hist. Ι. 57; 111.82; IV. 79; Aen. IV.
513 XIV. 36; Liv. XXVII. 31, 3; XXX. 14, 7. This very fact may

well have prompted Tacitus to choose the less hackneyed expression. ,

31, 23. vlsunova: nam, etc. As visu cova is in oppositio-a to
the preceding, secures· cannot be supplied, but without this, the acm
clause hangs completely in the air. This difficulty is done away
with, 11 we take oisc as a dative, as in Lucret. V. 101, or, should this
