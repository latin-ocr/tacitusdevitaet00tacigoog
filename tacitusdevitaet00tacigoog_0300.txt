cherish to her dying day, ior the immediately preceding and following
clauses clearly do not allow us to refer uiuendum to topace, and
pereundum to ia proelio. accipere ee: sc. artua. The relative
agrees with only a part 01 the composite antecedent (here the last
mentioned), boves and cquae being, oi course, excluded as possible
objects to be handed down to future generations. On this usage,
ep. 11010011. 2, 3 ; and ior an English exemplasse Huc’s Trcoela in
Thibet 11. 99, Fure aad gold which they collect from tlte ditat os their
maere.

γ 4. inviolata ac digna reddat: which alte might heracl oter antae
aialted to lter children aad render· worttp os passing to lter daughters-in·
lete, hy them ta turn tc be bepueatlted to their descendants. The
verb is best taken ἀπὸ κοινοῦ with inviolata and dignu quae . . . ucci-
picat. Nerua, the daughters-in-law, would receive the weapons from
their husbands in conformity with the statement in l. 26. The omis-
sion oi any mention oi her ,own daughters as recipiente oi arms is
noteworthy; partly because liberis is thus confined to the meaning ot
eone, partly because 1271. implies that the daughters¹ were not
excluded from this inheritance. The incongruity is due either to a
striving ior rhetorical conciseness or to the iact that women were not '
generally allowed to inherit. Cp. note to ch. 20, 511. Quae is also

⁴ used ἀπὸ κοινοῦ, as the object oi aecmicnt and the subject oi reserantur.
The same construction occurs in Tacitus again, Dial. 8, 16, Auta.
11. 83; and perhaps Ι. to. It is equally rare elsewhere, eg. Sall. ch.
14,10,31,18;101,0;1,11.Χ1111.0,12;801οε00010.

5. nepotes: either their descendants or lter prandeant. Theiormer
usage is iound only in the poete, occurring first in Catull. eg. XLIX.

· 1, thereaiter frequently, but not elsewhere in Tacitus, nor does he

employ the word in the sense oi grundchildrctt. Stylistic reasons
favor the first translation, while liberta-sons, may be urged on hehali
oi the second.

Ohaptcr 19. 6. Ergo: hence, ie. because oi this sanctity oi the
marriage. So eg. ch. 22, 8, the resumptive force 01 the particle
being much the rarer in Tacitus. Cp. note ch. 45, 4. saeptae:
taceat in, guarded. With the chiastic collocaticn oi saeptae. . .
conceptae, placed at the beginning and end to heighten the contram,
cp. ch. 14, 29 n, micant . . . 00111101, 42, 2 ii. praecipua . . . parta.
