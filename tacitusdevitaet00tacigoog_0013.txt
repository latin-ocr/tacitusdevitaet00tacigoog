tions, programmes, etc, as I had been unable to secure, were
happily accessible to me in the Bodleian Library and the B1itish

Museum, during the summere oi 1898 and 1899. For the sty-

listic treatment I have as heretoiore mainly relied upon my own

collectanea. =
The text oi this edition, though it departs from that oi Halm⁴

in more than fifty places, is conservative, ior iu eighteen instaures
Ireturn to the MSS, while in the others my readings are either
not without some MS. authority, or else the correction is oi the
simplest description possible aud imperatively demanded hythe
context or by Tacitean usage, as will be evident even from
the necessarily briei discussion iu the Critical Appendix.

Special peius have been bestowed upon the prosody of the proper
nemeaea iar as this may he determiucd by their occurrence in
poetry and the Greek transliterations, conflicting though their
evidence often is. The linguistic criteria so constantly employed
I have found quite unreliable, partly because oi the doubtful
etymology oi the names themselves, partly because they have
passed through a process of Latinization with all the prosodical
changes which that involved.

The innovation oi superimpoeing the modern upon the ancient
map designed to obviate the frequent necessity or expediency oi
consulting two maps, will, I hope, commend itseli to teachers and
studente alike.

In conclusion, l acknowledge with proiound gratitude the in·
valuable benefit which this book, in its passage through the prees,
has received at the hands oi my friends, Professors Charles Ε.

Bennett and John C. Rolie.
