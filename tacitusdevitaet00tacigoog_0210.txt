having but one instance, Lael. 10, 34. It was used in the present pas-
sage to indicate that the enemy approached in groups, not siugly, one

9. semineces for semivivos is a Vergilian word, frequent in post-
Augustan poetry, but very rare in prose; ag. Liv. XXIII. 15, 8 and
Tac. Hist. ΙΙΙ. 28. ln Greek, on the other hand, the very opposite
usage obtains, ἡμιθνὴς being quite common, whereas ὴμίζωος is not
found at all, except in very late writers,

10. equitum=equorurn,sc.Britanon1m. Here equivalenttoequi
sine rectoribus (see below). This confusion is met with as early as
Ennius, 237 V. quadrupes eques, and was imitated by Verg. Georq. III.
116 and othere. See the interesting discussion in Gell. Noct. Att.
XVIII. 5. With the acceptance oi this interpretation, which is espe-
cially probable in view of the very extensive indebtedness of Tacitus
to Vergil, all the difficulties, to which this paragraph has given rise,
disappear. turmae: croada as often of animals. The horses
with the driveriess chariots (ut supere scrinarii) rushed into the
midst of the battle. The hitherto universally accepted explanation,
which understands turmae of the Roman cavalry, fs incornpatible with
the meaning of miscuere, for, when used in a military sense, it never

some disturbing clement. The subject oi the three indicatives (intu-
lerant, haerebant, and incursabant) is thus the same, via, the equi
cunt curribus et sine rectoribus; while the subject of the one subjunc-
tive (impellerentur) is the Roman cavalry.

12. recentem terrorem: asresh scarae os panio, in addition to
that inspired by the victorious infantry. -The same phrase occurs
repeatedly. Cp. also note ch. 32, 18. densis. . . haerebant:
although the reinless horses rushed madly against their own side, they
nevertheless were hampered in their movements by the compact mass
of the Britons as well as hythe hilly surface. 'I'he result of this is

14. aequa, eta: although the corrupted text cannot be restored
with certainty, the meaning seems to have been that the Roman
