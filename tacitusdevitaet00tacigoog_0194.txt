25. pluribus: compluribus and below, l. 8, on which usage see
note ch. 25, 5.

26. incertum: because the enemy never knew where the Romans
might strike next.

2⁷. tortissimos et longa pace exploratos: best taken as 10101-
ring to two classes 01 natives. Agricola chose those British auxiliaries
who had proved themselves specially brave. To these he added some
others 110111 the long since pacified tribes 01 southern Britain, whose
loyalty had been tested and who had but recently been conscribed.
The traditional interpretation, identiiying the two, involves a contra
diction, ior fortitude is incompatibie with tocco parc. See ch. 11, 15 ff.

28. montem Graupium: the site oi this famous battle cannot be

determinari, largely owing to the vagueness which generally character-
izes the topographical description 01 battles in ancient historiens. See
note below, ch. 36, 26, and Introd. p. xvi.

Paga lt. 2. pugnae prioris: 01101126, 1211. expectantes:
loolcell to, in a general sense, without implying a hope to be realized,
which would not suit servitium.

Θ. tandem docti, etc. : cp. 1101001112, 24.

4. legationibus et toederibns: the et is epexegetic, the two terms
standing in causal relation. —The solemn compost, mentioned ch. 27,
2, must therefore, as legationibus here implies, be understood 01 other
tribes in the immediate neighborhood, 11 not actually 01 various 010110
01 one and the same tribe.

5. super triginta milia: on the indefinite number, see note ch.
37, 12. 011 the size 01 Agricola's forces, 000 ch. 35, 12 11,

6. adhuc = ic addition to these, ἐπὶ τούτοις. So frequently used

in Quintilian and Tadius, but rarcly elsewhere. armatorum: the ,

regular army. To these are added, in view 01 the emergency, the
veterani and the iuuenes inponat, probably those who had not yet
gone through the solemn investiture with arms at the tolk-moot or
assembly, on which see Tac. Germ. 13, 32; 20, 29. adfluebat: a
Vergilian phrase, eg. Aea. II. 796, ingentem comitum adfluxisse . . .
numerum.

7. 0111110 00 viridis senectus: another Vergilian expression,
taken 110111 Aeo. VI. 304, Iona senior, arderado cleociridlsquc senectus.

8. decora gestantes: cp. what Tac. Gerar. 31 says 01 the veteran
warriors among the Chatti. That such decoratione were also worn by
ltoman soldiers may be scen from Hist. ill. 10.
