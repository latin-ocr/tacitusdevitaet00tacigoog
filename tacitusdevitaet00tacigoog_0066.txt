But even granting that the Germania was under con·
siderably greater obligations to the authors discussed above¹
than the evidence will warrant us in assuming, there still
remaius a class oi topice, and they aro among the most
valuable and interesting in the entire treatisc, which arc
not so much as alluded to in any of our extant sources. I
mean the subject oi Germanic mythology, religione origins, .
and ritual. This information must have been based upon
the researches oi some scholar who devoted special atten-
tion to topice of this kind, aud it is, therefore, not without
significancc that Tacitus, particularly in these chapters,
repeatedly refers, contrary to his usual reticence, to some
previous authority.2 Can his identity be discovered?

Posidonius-Although the supposition does not admit
of positive proci, numerous indications clearly point to
the Stoic Posidonius oi Apamea as cneci the director
indirect sources of the Germanic.

This consummate scholar, the last and, next tc Aristotle,

Agrippa, ior ii it be true that Strabo, Mela, Pliny, Ptolemaeus, and
others made an extensive use oi lt, Tacitus cannot also have followed
it, as the irreconcilable divergences in the names oi tribes is sufficient
to prove. Mapr were very generally accessible at a comparatively
early date, as is clear irom the way one such is spoken oi in Prop.

followed the διόρθωσις τοῦ γεωγραφικοῦ πίνακος, the elaborate work of
Marinus oi Tyre, a contemporary geographer of distinction. Cp.

According to a method oi citation much in rogus among the ancients,
the plurals, like ἔνιοι, φασί, and the like, in Greek, do not necessarlly
imply more than one writer, the plural number being often duo to the
authorities cited in the source directly consulted.
