That this treatise fully merits the designation just given
to it will be manifest from some consideratione 01 a more
externa] nature.

In the first place, the arrangement 01 the multitudinous
details is of crystallino olearness, the work being dividcd
into two distinct parts. The ]1111(011.1-27,1) deals with
the geography and ethnology 01 Germanic renes in general
and considered as a national entity. The various topice,
moreovcr, follow in a most natural order, being often intro
duced by shilful 1111101110110,1 and the entire discussion most
appropriately oloscs with an account 01 German funeral
eustoms. The second (oh. 27, 2-end) takes up in detail the
specific history and characteristica 01 the indiuiduul tribeS,
the author pursuing, as before, a consistent and carefully' “
devised plan in their enumeration.2 Thronghout the treatise,
finally, Tacitus is fond 01 rounding off a topic or chapter by
an epigrammatic phrase³

As the Germanic is primarily a scientific treatise, the
canons and exigencies 01 ancient rhetorio forbade its being
composed wholly either in the oratorical or narrative style.⁴
Hence it is only where the authcr's enthusiasm or feelings
01 admiration cause him to abandon concrete exposition 101
