In the reign oi Tiberius, they occupied the territory once belonging
to the Sugambri, on the right bank of the river. They had
fought Lollius (li ao), Drusus (12 an), and J'oined the Batarian
uprising in 70 aa. The Usipi seem to have been finally subdued in
the reign cf Domitian, and they are found among the ausiliaries ol
Agricola in 83 an. cp. Ape. ch. 28. Their casual mention here may
well be due to 'l‘acitus's aversion to credit Domitian with their subju-
gation. What is said oi the Tencteri was in all probability equally
true oi the Usipi; at least, Caes. IV. 12, 1 i. confirma their equestrian
skill. colunt .“-. accolunt, druell alonp.

4. traduntur, etc: ii the statements in this passage, in spite
ci their rhetorical coloring, are to be accepted as on the whole
trustworthy, Tacitus attributes the custom ol primogenitura and testa·
tion to the Tencteri (and Usipi), as something. peculiar to them
alone, ior the former is significantly omitted in ch. 20, aff, while the
absence cf wills is especially noted as characteristic oi the Germane
generally; but the prout ferox, etc, could only have been determined
hy the testator in case there were several adult sons. We are not told
what disposition was made of the eqni in case there were no children,
or only daughters, surviving. excipit implies that the son adjudged
the bravest could claim the horses at once, without waiting ior the
regular distribution oi the rest ol the estate. Itis, however, intrinsi-
γ caily improbable that all the horses should have been given to this s0n;
more likely only the favorite steed oi the father passed to him.
