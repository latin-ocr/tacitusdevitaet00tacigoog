here attributed to these tribes is, as usual, a mere fancy (cp. note ch.
7, 5), as their vigorous opp'osition to Caesar proves.

21. per . . . gloriam: per for the instrumental ablativa is very
common in Tacitus. similitudine et'inertia: the speciflc term
added to the general, on which Tacitean usage cp. Intrad. p. lxviii. On
the slothfuiness of the Gauls, cp. i. 501111 Agr. 11, 1611. This is some-
what inconsistent with the statement 111 ch. 15, 611, and thusfurnishes
an additional proof 01 the purely rhetorical character of the passage.

22. Rheni ripam, wlreu used without an attributive like nostra,
dextra, or sinistra, significa the lest or Rontanside of the river. haud
dubie: to be taken, as indeed its position seems 10 indicate, with
Germanorum, not with calcant, to mark the contrast with the· preced-
ing pseudo-Germanic tribes.

23. Vangiones, Triboci, nemetes: the firstbad their principal
seat at Borbetomagus (Worms), the second probably at Argentora-
tum (Strassburg)‚ the last at Noviomagus (Speyer). They are found
among Roman auxiliaries and eventually constituted part 01 Ger-
mania Superior. See map. ¹

24. fibri: in the time of Caesar, they dwelt opposite the 'Treveri

and were, at their own nequest, transplanted to the 1011 bank 01 the
Rhine by M. Agrippa in 38 raa. quamquam with the subjunc-
tive is the usual construction in Tacitus. Romana colonia: in
51 r.1>.,and known officially as calonia (Coiogne, Kdln) Claudia
Arenaria Acnpptnensn, in honor 01 Agrippina, the wife 01 Claudius
and granddaughter 01 M. Agrippa. See below meruerint: had
the distinctiones being. With infinitive, in Tacitus also Ann. XIV.
48; XV. 67.
· 25. libentius: riphtpladly. Cp. notech. 11,]1. Agrippinen·
ses, etc: reiterated in Hist. IV. 28 ; Aren. XII. 27. conditoris
’ sul: sc. Agrippinae. Conditor, 01 0 woman, in place 01 conditrix,
which was notin use. Cp. also note cb. 7, li. The Ubii here re-
ferred 10 would hardly have remembered her grandfather, nor is it at
all probable that Tacitus had attributed the foundation 01 this settle-
ment to him, au error which he is further supposed to have corrected
iuAnn. ia.

26. origine: causal ablativo. With erabescere again eg. Agr. 42,
15. transgressi olim . . . conlocati: see note 1. 24. experi-
mento fidei : bacanse they tad niven proos as their layalty.

28. arcerent: sc. transrhenanos hortea a Romanis. custodi-
rentur: as eg. in the case of the Sugambri, in 8110.
