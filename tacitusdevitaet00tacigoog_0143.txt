synonymous expressions occurring with constantly decreasing fre-
quency from tha Dialogus to the second part of the Annulo, see
Iatrcd. p. nim-On the brachylogy in this sentence, sec Iatrod.
p. xxxiii. celeberrimus quisque, ingenio: clarissimo incenia.
Ingenium is not used in the singular in a personal sense, hence cele·
herciniam quodque inueniunt was impossible here. October: clarus
seems to occur first in Tibull. II. l, 33.

8. sine gratia aut ambitione: ie. without the desire oi camy-
ing favor or from selfish motivas. Our knowledge of the historiens
of the Republic, particularly the later annalista, does not bear out
this favorable view.

9. bonae . . . conscientiae pretio: ie. by the reward that
waits on duty well performed. Cp. Aah. ΙΙ. 22. - pretio = proemio.

10. plerique: many. This weakened sense is the more usual in
Tacitus and in post-Augustan Latin generally. suam ipsi: for arram
ipsos (= suunt ipsorum). We should have expected ipsos (subj. of
currere) in accordance with Tacitus's custom of making ipsc, when,
combined with a personui or possessive pronoun‚ the subj. For an
instance of the usage with a finite verb, see ch. 46, 25.—Observe that
two ideas here coalesco into one. (u) They wrote autobiographies.
(b) They did not think it open to censure to do so. — On the concise-
ness of this clause, see Introd. p. xxxiii.

11. Rutilio et Scauro: P. Rutilius Rufus, born about 158 ac,
cons. 105 rao, a distinguished orator, jurist, historiari, and pupil of
the Stoic Panaetius. In 93 nc. he was-accused by one Apicius oi

extortion. Besides his autobiography, orations, and· legal publica- .

ticns, he composed a Roman History in Greek. He is extravagantly
praised by Cicero and others-M. Aemilius Scaurus, his bitter
opponent, was born 162 a.c., and died about 89 ac. His antobiogra-
phy, in three books, seems to have been an apoloytu pro uita sua. -
et for cut, partly because these men are closely associated as contem-
poraries and antobiographers‚ partly owing to the cut following. lt
must be observed‚ however, that the Latin, as well as the Greek, has
a peculiar fondness for the copulative-conjunction, where our idiom
prefers the disjunctive particle. Cp. eg. buu καὶ τρεῖς (two or three) ;
ch. 29, 24 ; Gerra. 19, conrumpere ct conrumpa- Auu. II. 10.

12. citra :siaa Though extremely common in post-Augustan
Latin, especially in Quintilian, this usage is found in Tacitus only in
tho minor works. -On the collocation of a prepositional clause, and
an ablativo or dative, one oi the notaworthy features of Tacitean
