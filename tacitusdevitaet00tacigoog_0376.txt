ammons. 1111111011. 289

13, 6. ested] certis. See PH. pp. 31-33; ceteris—MSS.

14, 28. tueare] tuentur—AB. On the changeof subiect see
note ad loc. Two distinct statements are made, one concerning the
0001110εο11 another about the prinecps,¹ a potential subjunctive with
the indefinite second person is, therefore, out 01 place.

15, 5. non multum] <analecticam-Lipsius. cp. ΡΗ. p. 411.

16, 30. hiemis] hiemi-MSS. Scenoteadloc.

18, 21. pluribus] plurimis—MSS. See note ad loc.

18, 22. Το begin the cha'ptsr with Dotem, as Halm 'and others dc,
rudely destroys the skillul transition. See note ad loc.

18, 23. I should prefer to read 001101 et. cp. ch. 13, 1, pater ael
propinqum and above, ch. 5, 18.

19, 6. saepta] saeptae —early printed editione. Apart from the
rhetorical justification 01 this reading as given in note ad loa, 11 is
confirmed by numerous passages, in none 01 which the participle
agrees with the ablativo of the abstract noun. Eg. Cic. Parad. 1v.
1,27‚ animas . . . virtutibus . . . saeptas; Brut. 96, 330, saeptam
(sc. eloquentiam) liberali custodic; Liv. 111. 44, 4, amaia pudore
saepta. .

19, 20. maritum . . . matrimonium] nsatrlmoaiam . . .
maritam. On this transposition, see PH. p. 34 f. and note ad loc.

22, 29. occupat] occupet—Prammer. The error arose out 01
occepi] 10101001 in Tacitus and elsewhere invariably takes the sub-

9, where the verb is 01011101.

22, 8. ioci] loct-naeth. See PH. pp. 42-44.

2³, 171. st. . .vinoentur] <Si.. attractatus). That this
short paragraph cannot have been written by Tacitus has been shown

tion 011110 reasons which prompted the deletion may suffice.

(l) Indulserat and ebrietati, to fit into the context at all, must be
invested with meanings which these words do not appear to have
elsewhere, namely, to encourage, and 1000 os 1111011. (2) vitiis. The
faults which Tacitus imputes to the Germans are their 10010000, their
1001111010, and their passion sor parnbltap. But as these were ex·
