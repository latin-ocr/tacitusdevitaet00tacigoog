imaginable circumstances could have legitimately found a
place in it, wasnevcr composed as apolitical treatise and
would never have been recognized as such by any contem-

Again, if, as many scholare maintain, the Germanic was
primarily designed for Trajan, and secondarily for the
Roman public, then Tacitus' treatise was nothing less than
an aet of presumption and supererogation, for whatever
Trajau⁷s plans may have been, he was certainly iu excep
tionally favorable circumstances to learn at first head what
the author of the Germania could only have ascertained at
second huod, not to mention that the information concerning
the tribes beyond the Elbo, and of the remote North, would
have been both useless and irrelevant, for even in the wild-
est fligbts of alleged Roman expansionists, the conquest,
eg. of the Fenni, Sitones, and Aestii could never have been

’ contemplated.

Το these considerations, quite sufficient to disprove the
hypothesis of the politica] purpose of the Germanic, two
others may be added which, though equally strong, have
hitherto been overlooked.

The object of the historica] retrospect in ch. 37, which
deals with the disasters sustained by Roman arms at the
hands of northern barbarians within a periodos two centuries,
bas generally been supposed to be to inculcata the futility

1The inherent absurdity of the theory seems to have been felt by
Mlillenhoff, but he endeavors to neutralize it by an assertion so as-
tounding that it will be well to quote his own words, p. 16: “ That
this special motive and purpose (ie. the political) was suppressed by
Tacitus could only enhauce the effectiveuess of the treatise.. . .
Everything, and even this silence, thus points to this airn.” By such
reasoning almost anything could be demonstrated.
