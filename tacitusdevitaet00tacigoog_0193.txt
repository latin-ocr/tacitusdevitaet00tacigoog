110 noras. CHAPTER 29. [raca ia

18. Suebis . . . Frisiis: Suebi, according to Tac. Germ. 38, was
a collective designation ior· many tribes who occupied the greater part
oi Germany and led a more or less notnadic iiie, hence their name,
which means :conderem A Suebis oiishoot was settled by Augustus
in Flanders, and these are the people probably alluded to here. 'l'he
Frisii occupied the territory a little to the southwest, stretching irom
the eastern mouth oi the Ithine to the Eme.

19. in nostram usque ripam: i.e. the leit bank oi the Rhine.
'lhis proves that 'l'acitus conceived the Usipi to have sailed irom the
west arcund scotland, ior onany other supposition the adventurers
would have reached the Roman boundary before they were ship
wrecked and captured by the more northern Suebi and Frisians
mutatione ementium: commemini eschanna.

20. inlustravit: the indicative aiter sunt qui occurs occasionally
in poetry‚ but is extremely rare in prose. Iit-'Facitne again Dici.
37, 27, sant opaci qnos . . . meretur. Here a certain number oi the
Usipi are specially singled out irorn the rest.

Ohapter 29. 21. Initio aestatis: the seventh summer, 84 an.
ictus . . . amisit: strict logio would require ictuc cst, filio omaso,
bnt the participle and finite verb have a tendency tc interchange their
iunctions, particularly when the two acts are virtually coincident.
The construction is a Graecism; eg. Xen. Artcb. IV. 8, 253 Pind.
Nem. Vlll. 38. Frequently in Latin poetry, eg. Lucret. V. 514 ; Hor.
Ourna. 111. 6, 33; Lucan, VII. 581, but in prose ch. 5, 24, and Ana.
IV. 64 seem to be the only other analogous instances.

23. plerique tortium virorum ambitiose: ie. unlike many
brave men, Agricola did not ostentatiously display his sorrow, arithi-
tiose being often used in this sense. Hitherto plerique sortium ciro-
runt, etc, was taken in an ironicol sense, with direct reference to the
Stoice, but this is incompatible with the antithesis in muliebriter, nor
does Tacitus elsewhere ridicule the Stoics ior not practicing the ἀτα-
ραξία which they preached. On this truly Roman attitude, cp. Cic.
Tasc. Disp. II. 21, 49; Lucan, VIil. 617, and Tac. Ann. III. 6.
per lamenta . . . maerorem: words denoting pain or sorrow are
frequently combined in synonymic groups. Here the first more par-
ticularly expresses open, the second silent sorrow.

24. in luctu bellum, eto: a similar conduct is attributed to
Alexander (Plut. Alea. 72) and Tiberius (Ano. iv. 8). nuans:
on the other hacid. See note ch. 20, 19.
