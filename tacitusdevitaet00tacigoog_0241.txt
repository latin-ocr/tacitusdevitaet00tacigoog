CRITICAL APPENDIX TO
THE AGRIOOLA.

Tun deviatione from the text oi Halm⁴ herc noted follow the
bracket- 0. R. refers to my Notos to the Agricola in the Classical
Reoiew, vol. XI. (1897), pp. 325-332.-F. to Furneaux’s edition,
exford, 1898.-A(r)= Vat. 34293 B(A)= Vat. 4498.

Chapter 3, line 12. set] et-MSS. See F. ad loo.

4, 16. ultraquam] ultroque ortam—Baehrens. cp. 0. R. 325.

4,17. ac senatori] (oc senatori). enuntio. Andresen (and
F. isdisposed to agree with him) has objected to this deletion on the
ground that senatori may be taken in an anticipatory sense, as in Diui.
28, 3, principes liberos (destined to be leaders) and Aren. III. 59, rec-
torem generis hamoni (the future ruler). This explanation would be
acceptable ii the text read uc correcti, expressive oi the highest attain-
able goal, as in the examples just cited; butte reach senatorial rank
was certainly no conspicuous achievement‚ and its mention immedi-
ately upon Romano is in the nature oi an autielimax.

6, 18. 20. pro consuls. . . proconsule] proconsulem . . .
procacem.

6, 27. tenor] icertier-MSS. No satisfactory, emendation of this
admittedly corrupt reading has yet been proposed. Tener (Rhena-
nus) gives a tolerable sense, but it is paleographically out oi the ques-
tion, and the word does not occur elsewhere in Tacitus. cp. 0. R.
325.

6, 29. medlo rationis] medio moderationis. Cp. GR. 326.

6, 2. aflecit] fecit-MSS. cp. Cic. io Verr. V. 2, 53 ovid, ee
Pont. 1. 1, 65.

8, 23. dignum est: Tacitus elsewhere omits the copula aiter dlo-
nora and indignum. See 0. R. 326. Ι have now retained it with the
MSS. because the ellipsis oi the copula had not yet reached the pro-
portions it had in the later writings. See Iatrod. p. xxxii. Possibly

also, as Andresen suggests, it may have been here designedly expresssd
to prevent erat from being understood.
