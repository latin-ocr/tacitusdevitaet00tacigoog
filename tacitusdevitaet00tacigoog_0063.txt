Tacitus wholly ignores 'the Burgodiones, Oderint, Srcpumbri,
and knows of but one peris Chaucorum.

But it is upon the description of amber (ch. 45) that
Tacitean indebtedness to Pliny's encyclopaedia is alleged to
rest most securely,f01· the latter devotes no fewer than
sixteen paragraphs to this very subject (N. H. XXXVII. 2,
11, 30-46), his very enumeration of the many authors who
dealt with tho origin and provenance of amber showing
clearly, as may be observed in passing, that an extensive
literature concerning this substance existed before Pliny's
time. .Now, it is certainly not without significance that the
one noteworthy agreement1 between him and Tacitus (for
,the other coincidences of statement pertain to details of
unquestionably common knowledge and pbservation) is
expressly cited as a fact known to prisci ricuniri. On the
other hand, Tacitus gives a number of details not found in
Pliny. Thus the former conspicuously mentions the Aestii
as engaged in theamber trade, and speaks only of the Baltic
Sea3 the latter says nothing of this tribe, and refers only
to the shores of the North Sea as the region where the
amber came from.2

If any further proof of Tacitus' independence of Pliny
were needed, it would be furnished by their widely dis-
crepant and irreconcilable descriptions of the (licetret.8 Pliny
picturas them as living in sordid poverty and devoid of all

wrote Suionibus (mentioned by T. immediately alter his account of
amber) instead ol (titionibus, an otherwise wholly unknown name
which he cites from Pytheas.
