archaism be thought inadmissible, if we write 01001 (sc. Romanorum),
a conjecture which scarcely involves any change at all (01000000).
We thus secure a periectly Tacitean asyndeton bioeemhre. Seotper
may now be legitimately supplied, narn, eta, pointing out that this
peculiar attire 01 the Chatti was always a source of astonishment to
the Romans, because it was retained even in times oi peace.

³³, 8. penitus] poene tom. cp. PH. p. 381.

33, 16. urguentibus] arcentibus. This is demonstrably the more
correct orthography.

35, 2. recedit] redit—MSS. Simply because of a parallel use
ol recedere in Pomp. Mela, 111. 1, 8, editors have followed Heraeus in
rejecting a wholly unobjectionable word against the unanimous tes-
timony oi the MSS. But, 1101 10 mention that en emendation not
called ior by textual corruption, excellent though it be, is ipso secto
false, the same figurative use of redire is found not only in Verg.

indebtedness oi Tacitus to Vergilian phraseology (seo Iatrod. p. lxx),
but it actually occurs troico in none other than Melo himself, See

35,16. The repeated collocation in Tacitus 01 raptres and lotro-
ciaio leaves no doubt in my mind that he heracleo, as elsewhere,
wrote et (oc) not out.

35, 11. idque, at the beginning 01 0 sentence, is far more com-
mon than td in Tacitus. Cp. esp. Hist. IV. 36, idque praecipuum.
Where -que is omitted, as in Hist. 11. 96, id praeceperim Germ. 46,

35, 13. poscat (exercitus), plurimum] poscet, coercitus (sc. est)
plurimorum. This simple emendation oi the much molested passage
merely involves the assumption 01 011 easily neglected solution 01 a
compendium. The deletion oi exercitus, on the other hand, is methodi·
cally quite unjustifiable, as are 011 the other changes hitherto proposed.
Nor can exercitas be taken as 1110 object of poscat, ior si (ot, prout) res
poscitis a formulaic parenthesis oi especially frequent occurrence in
Tacitus.

36, 20. superiori] superioris-MSS. A certain instance oi the
dative with rtomec, though exceedingly common in other writers, is
perhaps found in Tacitus only ch. 43, 27, the e immediately following
