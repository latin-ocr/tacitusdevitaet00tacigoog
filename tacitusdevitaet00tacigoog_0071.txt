ΙΙΙ.

. THE rkusrwokrmusss OF THE GERMANIA.

The trustworthiness of the varied and extensive informa
tion imparted in the Germania is ¹directly conditioned by
the nature of the sources consulted. That these comprised
the very best available iu the author’s time can admit of no
question, but the following considerations may serve to con-
firm the highly authentic character of this treatise.

In the first place, we meet with scarcely a single sterte-
raeut offeci which can be said to be inherently improbable
or incredible.l The significance of this observation will
be appreciated at its proper velue, if we compare the
accounts in Strabo, Diodorus, Mela, Pliny, arrd even Caesam
for these abound in numerous details which every modern
reader will at once recognize as sabulone, grotesque, or im-
possible. Α

In the second place, it may be asserted, without qualifi-
cation, that Tacitus has not been convicted of a solitury
ruisatotemcnt, saliere he ncipit cr mast leuve hriown better. Not
that this treatise is faultless3 on the contrary, it contains
many items of information which modern scholarship must
reject or, at least, modify3 but in every instance the error
is due to well-recognizable causes. The passage is either
obscure and misleading, owing to a desire for extreme con-
ciseness of expression, or else Tacitus deals with topios on

able number oi passages on Germanic geography and ethnology, it was
strangely, but without exception persistently‚iguored by Roman writers.

¹There are a few details which might make this impression, but
while Tacitus did not cereto omit them altogether, he himself ex-
presses his doubts as to their authenticity. Cp. ch. 2, ὃς 3, 1 ff.;
t, 20 ; 34, at; 40, 14, 46, 24 ff.
