rias a] roras, oanrrna 3. 63

8. adempto. . . conmerolo refers to the nefarious practice of
informem, so frequently denounoed by Tacitus, eg. Ana. IV. 30,
delatores, peteres homiuum publico exitio repertum.

Ohapter 3. 12. et quamquamquamquam aretem. So ch. 36,

11,-6666666666 with the subjunctive occurs sixty times in Tacitus,
to twenty instantes with the indicative.

13. primo statim. . .ortu: ot tlte very beplacito os tlte down.
Primo statim occurs repeatedly in Tacitus. For the extremely com-
mon pleonasm with words denoting a beginning, see note Dici. 11, 18.
Nerva caesar: The references to Trajan, below and 44, 6, imply -
the death of Nerva (Jan. 27, 98 an). Diuus was probably omitted,
because the official consecration had not yet taken place.

14. dissociabiles=iasociubiles (Tac. Ana IV. 12; XIII. 17)
incorapotible ,· in this sense only here and Claud. in Rus. ll. 238. The
same negativa] force of the prefix is found, e.g.‚ in dissimilis, die-

· plicare. principatum ac libertatem: the antithesis seems tohave

been a commonplace. cp. Plut. Galba, 6, 666 Τ66. Hist. IV. 64, baad
sutile libertos ct domiai miscentur. The word libertos appears ou
inscriptions in reference to the accession of Nerva.

16. Securitas Publica like our Oootmouweeltb, is frequently ¹
personified, especially on coins. Vota were vows and prayers offered
up for the continued welfare oi the state on the occasion of the acces-
sion of a new emperor. So recorded eg. in the case of Trajan, Jan 3,
98 an. -Some verb like conceperit must be supplied by zeugma from
adsumpserit. For other instances of zeugma, see Iatrod. p. xxxii.

17. fiduciam ec robur: arroso oasaronce of tte reulteotioa os
tlte prayer. Hendiadys, although the two nouus were primarily used
for the sake of symmetry with spem oc ootaoe.

19. lente. . . extinguuntur: an asyndetic'antithesis, the adver-
sative particle being, ior the sake of conciseness, generally omitted.
So eg. ch. 12, 6, tarde mitescunt, cito proveniunt. -On the brachylogy
see Iatrod. p. xxxiii. With the thought op. Lucret. 1. 666.

20. subit: sc. antonum. Apparently not elsewhere used abso-
lutely in this sense. quippe = enim, so very frequent in Tacitus.
but in anastrophe only here and in the Aeaeis.

22. Quid? sl usually introduces a concrete illustration of a gen-
eral proposition. cp. Dici. 20, 10. per quindecim annos: lethe
reign of Domitian (tt-oo).

23. grande. .“ . spatium: so styled, because of the crushing effect
