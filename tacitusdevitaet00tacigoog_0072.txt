which the information obtainable must bave been scanty,
vague, and unreliable.¹ In these cases, he has at times
yieldcd to the temptation to which, as he himself tells us,
both ‹Livy and Rusticus succumbed in their description oi
Britain, who quae condem coctpertu eloquentia percoluere
(Agr. ch. 10, 4). The tendency, moreover, to formulate a
well-balanced antithesis and to close a chapter with a neatly
turned epigram has occasionally resulted in slight incon-
gruities or unwarranted inferences

But though the concrete rnaterial accumulatcd in the Ger·
rrccclc must be pronounced eminently trustworthy and
valuable, the same fidelity to ascertainable truth cannot be
claimed for the numerous reflectione, metirer, feellnpe, or
idcele which Tacitus attributes to the Germane. They are
almost without exception ianciful² and, in at least one
instance,³ border on the grotesque. But these imaginative
passages are due, partly to the romantio halo with which
Tacitus, as pointed out above, invested the barbarian races
of the north, partly to his sincere admiration of praise-
worthy qualities which they actually possessed, but which
he failed to find in the civilized society of his time. The

very stylistic dress iu which these reflections are generally
presented also merlis them off clearly from the strictly
historica] information, and hence, so far from deceiviug the
reader, these poetical features impert to an otherwise purely
scientific trectise on ethnology and geography that irresist
ible fascination which the Gerrcocic shares with every
consummate work of art.

1 These passages are especially noteworthy; as showing how careiul
the author was to give only what he had reason to believe to be genu-
ine and trustworthy, this design being in striking contrast with the
naive credulity and the lack oi discrimination displayed, e.g., by Mela,
Pliny, and others.
