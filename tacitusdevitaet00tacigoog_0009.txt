been allowed to intrude. In not burdening the commentary with
scrupulous acknowledgment for every real obligation incurred,
imperative as this would be in an edition intended for scholare, 1
have ventured to follow a well-recognized precedent. Nor have
I, for reasons of brevity, called attention, except in afew instances,
to the existence of other interpretatione than those, whether new
or old, which Ι deemed sufficiently convincing to warrant accept
ance. Under these circumstances Ι gladly take this opportunity
of saying that, 01 all the editions accessible to me, Ι have found
' those of Wex, Peter, Andresen, and Furneaux especially helpful

· and suggestive; and Ι only regret that, having profited so rnuch

by their labore, Ι should have been compelled to dissent from
their views so frequently, though 1 hope never without valid
reasons. That I have again made every possible use of the ad·
mirable Lexicon Taciteum, unfortunatcly not yet finished, will be
evident from my N otes.

The text has been subjected to a thorough revision, and may
claim to represent an independent recension. It differs from that
of Halm⁴ 'm nearly sixty instances, the justification of these devia·
tions being given, as briefly as possible, in a Critical Appendix.
It is a matter of great regret that Ι had to be deprived of the
benefit which the third known Ms. of the Agricola, discovered by
Dr. R. Wuensch in Toledo, might have proved to be for the con-
stitution of a better text than is now possible. But the most
strenuous efforts to secure a copy, photograph‚ or collation have
been alihe unavailing, owing to the unfortunate attitude of the
prolate of Toledo, who, though incapable of reading the Me.
himself, has absolutely prohibited its inspection, on the ground
that a Ms. once made known loses all its value.

In conclusion, I have again the pleasurc 01 acknowledging with
gratitude the most welcome and valuable aid which my old friends,
Professor John C. Rolfe of the University of Michigan and Pro-
fessor Charles E. Bennett of Cornell University, have so ungrudg·
ingly given to thie book in its passage through the prese.
