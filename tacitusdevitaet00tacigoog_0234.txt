present happy age, and he prophetieally ioretold the accession oi
'lhajan to the throne. Trajan's achievements in Germany beiore
91 s.n.‚ the year oi his consulship, had drawn attention to him, as in
the similar case oi Vespasiae (ch. 13, 28 ii.) and his future greatness
seems to have been generally predicted. Cp. Plin. Peneo ὁ, 943 Dio
Cass. LXVII. 12, 1. The involved structure oi the sentence was due
to the author's striving aiter conciseness.

7. apud nostras suris: tn my presence. An instance of synec-
doche. This particular quasi-personification occurs in four other
Tacitean passages, viz. Hist. I. 26; Ann. 1.31; 11.39; IV. 29, but
apparently not elsewhere. eminebatur = ouyurodatur et acide
optabat. An instance oi the so-called constructio praecoces. Cp.
Introd. p. xxxiii. testinatae mortis: objectiva genitive. The
passive meaning is first iound in Sallust, eg. Iup. 64, 63 with the
implication oi prematurely inflicted death, eg. luv. IV. 951, rnors
. . . festinata.

8. επιείεεοι sc. eum, isthe subiect oi solacium tulit, sc. nobis, as
contrasted with sicut ei (l. ὃ).

9. spiramenta: in this figurative sense the word occurs only here
and in Tacitus's imitator, Amm. Marcell. XXIX. 1, 40, who substitutes
moro ior interocllc; XIV. 7, 15.

10. continuo et velut uno ictu: i.e. blows dealt out so un-
ceasingly as to amount to hut a single stroke. continuo ie not used
as an adverb by Tacitus, but may be conveniently translated as such
here.

11. exhaus1t=persodit; merely a strengthened form oi haurire
which is very often used in this sense. Cp. ag. Claud. Quadrig. apud
Geli. N. A. IX. 13, li; Lucret. V. 13223 Liv. VII. 10, 10, uno allero-
que snbinde ictu uentrem atcere inguine heusit; Tac. Hist. I. 41,
iaculum eius derisisse. The other, generally accepted meaning, to .
drinio up the blood, sup the strength os, though still more common both
in the simple and compound verb, would unnecessarily introduce a
mixed metaphor.

Ohaptsr 45. 12. Non vidit, etc: such passages are typical oi
rhetorical consolationes, a species oi composition much cultivated in
ancient literature. Cp. Cic. de orat. ΙΙΙ. 2, 8, non cidit (sc. Crassus)
flagrantem bello Italion . . . uon sceleris nesorii principes ciuitatis
reos. . . non erilium ceneri, uon . . . 0. Mori ¹litgntrn . . . non
