life. -P. Cornelius Tacitus seems to have been horn of
an equestm'an family in northern Italy.¹ The date of his
birth can be only approximately determined from a refer·
enee in the correspondence of Pliny the Younger, Tacitus's
intimate and lifelong friend. In a letter addressed to
Tacitus (Epist. VII. 20, 24) we are told that· the latter,
though propemodum aequalis, had already achieved a great
oratorical reputation, while he himself was still adelescen-
tulus. The allusion is quite vague, but as Pliny was born
in 62 nn, having reached his eighteenth year at the time
of the destruction of Pompeji in 79 nn, Tacitus cannot
well have been born earlier than 54s55 an, 5 date which
agrees with what little other biographical information we
possessos him. He seems to have received his education
in Romaion it is all hut certain that he was, like Pliny, a
pupil of Quintilian. 'At all events, his earliest extant worlr,
the Dialogus de oratoribus, published not later than the

reign of Titus (ra-81 A.n.), exhibite many elear traces of Ι

the influenee of that great macher? According 5ο his own

literature was 5 native Roman.
