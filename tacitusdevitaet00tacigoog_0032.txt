11010,οε we have seen, larger, 11 1101 wholly, works 01 110
creative imagination.

To what extent, finally, books, 11 any, were consulted 101·
110 account 01 110 0111101000 and peooroplryl 01 Britain, it is
impossible to determine. Tacitus himself was certainly
acquainted with. the most important works dealing with
these topics, 101 10 singles out Livy and Fabius Rusticus
as the most famous out 01 many accessible to hi1n‚² assur-
ing us that their information was scanty and unreliable‚ he
being in possession 01 more authentia details. Caesar,
whom Tacitus styles salamas aetolorum in the Gainounia
(ch. 28, 5), seems not to have been consulted‚ 01 rather he
was intentionally ignored, 101110 cannot be included among
those who 1101110111 comperto eloquentia percoluere (ch. 10, 4),
a statement in no sense applicable to the short paragraphs
which Caesar has devoted to the 0111]’001.3

That he made direct use 01 any Greek sources, such as
Pytheas 01 Massilia, Strab0, Diodorus, or even Posidonius,
whose works on physieal geography and ethnology marked
the highest point which scientific researeh into these subjects
reached in antiquity, is extremely doubtful, 101 Tacitus’s
explanations 01110 long days 0111110 tides are unscientific;
and in holding to the disk-shaped 10111 01 110 00111, 10 is
deplorably behind the knowledge even 01 his own time.

1Β. G. IV. 33; V. 12-14. Caesar seems to imply that the Britons
had cavalry as well as chariot ligmers, whereas Tacitus mentions only
the latter, whom he calls cocleriorlc', 101 which Caesar says essedarii.
But the contradiction is, perhaps only apparent, 101 Tacitus is speak-
ing 01 1110 Caledonians, Caesar 01 110 britone in Kent, and what was
true 01 tho latter was not necessarily applicabis 101110 former.
