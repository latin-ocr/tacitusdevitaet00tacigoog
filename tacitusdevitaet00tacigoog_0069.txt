The identification of Germanic deities with the gods of
Rome and Greece was familiar to Caesar.l This process
must, therefore, antedate the de Bello Gallico, but if so,
there is no one, save Posidonius, to whom its general intro-
duction² een plausibly be attributed, for he is the only
previous scholar, so far es known, who paid any attention
to tho mythology of Germanic and Celtic raees.

Summing up this entire discussion, the following conclu-
sions may be 'set down as reasonably established: -

1. The material collected in the Germanic is taken en-
tirely at second hond, for the hypothesis that Tacitus himself
visited German territory has nothing in its favor and every-
thing against it.

2. There is every reason to believe that avery consider-
able mass of details, far more than has generally been
supposed, was furnished direotly to the author by friends

· 1Β. d. VI. 17, 1ff.; 21, t, where he says that Mercury‚ Apollo,
Mars, Jupiter, and Minerva were the deities worshipped by the Gauls,
but only the Sun, Vulcan‚ and the Moon by the Germane. See note
ch. 9, 28.

²The fact that Tacitus styles thir method interpretatio Romana
(ch. 43, 27) does not necessitate the assumption of a Roman source,
for its origin is unquestionably Greek, as is evident from the identifi-
cation of Donor and the Alci with Hercules and the Dioscuri (notes
ch. 9, 27 ; 43, ab n), these gods or demigods havlng no fixed place
in the Roman Pantheon. Probably shortly after Posidonius, some
Roman antiquarlan substituted Jupiter for Hercules, end this genuine
interpretatio Bouiano was universally accepted, as is clear from the
Fr. Jeudi (Jcrie dies) by the eide of Germ. Donneretop (Donar's
day), Engl. Thurrdoy. Sutcrdoy (Saturni dies) also points to a
Roman origin. The Latin authority may well have been Varro, in
his librarentur divinarum, published in 47 ac. and dedicated to
Caesar. Posidonius was demonstrably one of the sources of this great
work, and Tacitus may also have been indebted to it, but in mention-
ing Hercules, to the exclusion of Jupiter, he clearly follows the iater-
pretatio Graeco.
