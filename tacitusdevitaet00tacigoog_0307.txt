ation, ior the Werycld ol a noble was usually twice that oi an ordinary
ireeman. cp. note ch. 12, 23. Originally, all cases oi homicide called
ior blood vongeance, but with the emergente irom primitive conditione,
in Tacitus' time, satisfactio or compositio came ιο be regarded as an
adequate substitute, and, ii agreed ιο by the culprit'a relatives, the
olan to which the murdered man belonged would be morally pledged
to discontinue the ieud. The motivo here given ior this more humane
practice does not, oi course, represent the actual reasoning oi the
Germana (cp. note ch. t, t), but was a natural result oi adeveloping
civilization. An explanation analogous to that oi Tacitus is, however,
offered by Lucretius (V. 1145 tt.) ior a similer change. armento·

14. utiliter in publicum sc. hoc fit, aprocedure cf advantage ιο
tlte communitp. With the phrase, cp. Liv. IV. 6, 2, utiliter itt praesens
certamen respondit. < As the claitse is in apposition to recipit . . .
doinus, we should expect sitite, a heaefit to, in accordante with a well-
attcsted Tacitean usage. Cp. eg. Hist. 1. 44, aperiesque . . . interfici
iussit . . . munimentum adpraesens.

15. iuxta libertatern: ta proportioa to tite libertyembyed. For
other peculiar uses oi this proposition, apparently confined to Tacitus,
cp. ch. 30, 8, end Dici. 22, 2.

16. Convictibus et hoepItiis: fecsts amonp themselves ond enter-

'teiaments os stranpers. The latter are discussed first, while the two
following chapters deal with the iormer. eiiusius indulget: is
more immoderately addirted. cp. Hist. I. 19, effusius secere.

hospitality are rigidly observed among primitive peoples and in newly
settled, isolated communities, the custcm being primarilydue ιο seli-

the same courtesy to non-Germanic peoples. The Roman attitude
is best reflected in the word tostis, thch originally stood for both
strcnper (cp. our host, Germ. post) and cnetnp. Monetium, a
more emphatic term than tornines, was first introduced into prose
by Sallust. ¹
