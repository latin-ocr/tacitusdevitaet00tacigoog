26. quiete et otio: on this and a similar often recurring group
of synonyme, see ch. 21, 26; 40, 9; 42, 9, and note Dicl. 39, 28.
gnarus: to he joined to temporam.

27. inertie pro sapientia: with the thought, op. Hist. I. 49,
sed claritas natalium . . . obtentui, at, quod segnitia erat, sapientia
vocaretur. In Agricola, however, the conditione were reversed.
idem. . . silentium: the meaning of this statement, though cor·
rupted in the Mss, is clear. Agricola's praetorship passed without
any features worthy of record. The ct is epexegetic.

28. iurisdictio: during the Empire, the number of praetors occa-
sionally rose as high as eighteen, but only the praetor urbanas and
praetor peregrinus possessed ex officio civil jurisdiction. 'l'he absence
oi these judicial functione, therefore, still further accounts ior the
inconspicuous character oi Agricola's incumbency oi the office.
ludos . . . duxit: a Tacitean coinage modeled upon pompam ·
(funus) ducere, and employed to avoid the stereotyped phrase ludos
secere. This tendency to discard the trite and conrmonplace is one of
the most significant features ol Tacitean style. cp. Iatrod. p. xxxv.

29. inania honoris: with irvcuic supply calentior the lardi are
included among these. Translate: aad what other erupto pcyeactry os
tlte office there toas. medio moderationis: ie. these gamos he

The genitive with medias is chiefly poetic. In Tacitus again, Aru. Ι.
64, medic montium ct paludum.

30. uti . . . ita = cccccccccc-tamea. This adversative use of
ut—itc is especially frequent iu Livy and Tacitus. lamae propior:
i.e. he came nearcr to acquiring distinction in this matter than one
would have expected, because reckless extravagance in furnishing
amusement to the people was the time-honored method of gaining
popularity. The statement furnishes a good illustration of Tacitus's
skill in turning to his hero’s credit what was at best an indifferent
performence.

Pege 5. 1. dona, eta: probably this refers to temple property
carried away hy private individuals during the great fire under Ner0,
who had himself replenished his own losses by depleting the temples
throughout the empire of their art treasures. These latter were now
beyond restitution‚ but the others were collected with such success
that the commonwealth no more felt their absence than if they had
never been removed. This idea is implied fn the pluperlect. Fora
