'1'th SOURCES OF THE GERMANIA. lix

That the works oi Posidonius, more particularly the
exhaustive account 01 the Cimbri and Teutones, must have
constituted a weloome repository of trustworthy informa
tion on Germany can still be shown, ior apart from the fact
already pointed out, that the above-mentioned narrative
remained the standard treatment of those tribes, we owe to
Posidonius the first mention of the name Germani ¹ and the
first description of that oountry.²

Under these circumstances, it does not seem probable that
Tacitus would have failed to avail himself of the labors oi
so reliahlc, so suggestive, and so learned an authority, whose
very attitude of mind and point of view, moreover, as mani-
fested, eg, in his tendenoy to idealize barbarian races, must
have been singularly sympathetic to our author.³ Although
the precise nature and extent oi this indehtedness must, oi
course, remain problematical, there is at least one piece oi
detailed iniormation in the Germanic for which Posidonius

seems reasonably certain to have been, if not the direct, yet
the ultimate source.

1Athen. 1v. p. 153 e. MblIenhoil, D. A. ll. pp. 153 ff, intent
upon proving that Caesar was the first to distinguish the Gelts from
' the Germans, is finally driven to the arbitrary hypothesis that Athe-
naeus interpolated the name into his direct citatiou irorn Posidonius
aud that Strabo, Valerius Maximus, Velleius, and Diodorus all wan-
tonly changed the terms Patami, Κελτοί, or Galli, given in their
sources, to Germani. But Caesar was already acquainted with the
latter designation before he encouutered German tribes, and as he
regards the Cimbri and Teutones as Germanic, nothing iuniore
plausible than that their great historian, Posidonius, had done so
too. Cp. also PitiloI. LVIII. p. 29. Caesar knew but few trans-
Rhenish people intimately, and, il hc clearly differentiated these from
the Celtic Gauls, it does not follow that he had deternrined the racial
distinctions oi the German peoples asa whole, as 'incitus did, cn the
strength 01 the extensive information at his disposal.
