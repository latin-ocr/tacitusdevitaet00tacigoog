and genuine reprcduction.¹

The ancients resorted to this rhetorical expedient in the
conviction that by so doing they could more vividly and
objectively portray the feelings and the motives by which
the principal characters were actuated, and thus at the
same time detine the issues and reflect the spirit of the
contending parties.² Ι

Now, inasmuch as Tacitus was writing the life, not of a
poet or scientist or philosopher, but of a general who was
himself helping to make history, it was inevitable that he
should deal with πράξεις, which were the special province of⁴
the historiar, and thus the rhetorical exigencies of historical
prose of which speeohes constituted an integral part, would
be sufficient to justify their insertion in this strictly histori-
cal portion of his biography, If the speeohes of Calgacus
and Agricola are to be condemned as irrelevant in a genuine
biography, the description of the battle, constituting as it
did an equally integral feature of historical narrative,8
should have met with the same condemnation, and yet no
one has ever made the least objection to it in spite of its
rhetorical and all but imaginative character.⁴

2 The sterectyped rhetorical characteres these military harangucs is
perhaps best shown by the numerous parallelisms in sentiment, often
expressed in similar phraseology, found in the speeohes of Thucydides,
Livy, Curtius, and Sallust, although in the case of the last mentioned
direct indebtedness of Tacitus is reasonably certain. See below.
