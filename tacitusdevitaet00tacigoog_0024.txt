for his hero.l
The speeohes. -Ι turn to a consideration of the speeohes.

.' lt is well known that these form aconspicuous aud unique

feature of classical historiography from Thucydides down

¹ , to Ammianus Marcellinus, the last of the great historiens

of antiquity‚ addresses to soldiers on the eve of a battle
being by far the most numerous. These speeohes, more-
cver, are, without exception, either wholly or lar-gely fieti·
tious, for in the majority of instances circumstances naturally
prevented actual speeohes of any length from being deliv-

'ered at all, or, if they were, the historiari could have had

no accurate knowledge of their contents. The author,
therefore, simply put into the mouth of the speaker the
sentiments which he (learned fitting to the occasion, his
imagination being occasionally aided by reports of what
was actually said.² But whether fictitious or only partly
so, the ancient historian invariably cast the speech into his
own stylistic mould, as we may still demonstrate by a ccm-
parison of the speech of Claudius in Tacitus and the actual
address of tlre emperor, which happens to be preserved.³

But while the fiction of actual delivery is maintained ,

throughout, no deception was intended or involved, lor
even though historiens do not, like Thucydides, take the
reader into their confidence, the speeohes are always intro-

a year had elapsed between ch. 28 and ch. 29, does not oi course effect
the reader. Besides, it involves the unreasonable demand ol a strict
observance oi the unity ol time, which is not insistcd upon even by
Aristotle.
