listic originality, may well have exerted a powerlul attrac-
tion upon amiud such as Tacitus’s. But, at the same time,
he seems to have been captivated hythe nobility 01 Ver-
911106 diction. In the Historias and nauus he to some
extent emancipated himself 110111 the style ol Sallust, but
the influeuce cf the great poet never waned, remaining con-
spicuously in evidence in all his werke.

In the Agricola these two streame still blend in happy
harmony, producing a style as far removed from the ‘milky
richness' 01 the Dialopas as it is from the succinctness 01
expression 111 the Historias, or the still greater conciseness
01 the Annnls. But a man 01 such literary gifts as Tacitus
is never a mere imitator, and hence we find that certain
features characteristic 01 his mature and developed style
already appear in the Agricola, his earliest treatise of an
, historica] character. The most noteworthy 01 these are a
straining 101 the utmost brevity, which occasionally resultcd
in ohscurity‚ and a deliberate avoidance ol the commonplace,
the trite, or formulaic, which led him to coin new expres-
sions, 01 to give a novel tur'n to old ones

The following survey aims to give in a conveniently tabu-
lated form a collection 01 the most interesting stylistic and
rhetorical features met with in this treatise.l
