resembling wine. On this geneum signification, like insumus (note cb. 4,
b), see eg. Stat. Acuti. l. 308, ebur conrumpitur ostro. Amm. Marcel·
linus, a frequent imitator 01 Tacitus, seems to have had this very pas·-

among the Gauls, a rece also said to have been excessively addicted to
this beverage.

14. agrestia poma: apples os tlte fields, as distinguished from
those grown in orchards, which were unknown to the Germane. Cp.
