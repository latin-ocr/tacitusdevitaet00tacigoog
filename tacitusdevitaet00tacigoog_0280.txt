de maioribus: perhaps those enumerated in ch. 22, 20, 00 which

tions involving life and death.

31. omnes=ol πάντες, the plebs. So frequently, especially in
antithesis. Cp. ch. li. 45 46, 4; Dici. 40. 18. es quoque, etc:
ie. res maiores.

Pago 38, 2. nisi qiud fortuitum st subitum incidit: except io
the ease os 00 0000000000 arrd sudden cmerpeacy. The two adjectives

3. incohatur luna ant impletur: on the medial position of the

The calculatiou by lunar months invariably antedates the soler calen-
dar, the new or full moon being, moreover, among most races regarded
00 particularly propitious. So the Spartans refused to fight before the
tull moon (Herod. VI. 106), aud Ariovistus awaited the new moon
before engaging iu battle (Caes. B. 0. I. 50, l). Tacitus does not state
that these maetings took place every two weeks, aud they probably
did not-but simply that they would not be called except at such
a time for the reason given. Cp. the Auglo-Saron Andreas 157 f. -:
they held 00ον conatii oflcr thirty 0101000. μ

οο similarly, eriat. X. 1, 85, o. 0000011000.

5. 100οε0000ᾶο0,οη01100000. So often in Tacitus. noctium:
this was the natural outcome of reckoning time by the moon's changes.
It iestill in voguc in Arabian and Hebrew ritual, aud is attributed by
Macrob, Sot. 1. 3, 00 0100 Atheniens of historical times Engl. fortalicii,
00001001 (now obsoleta), ticelsth 000101, 1001100000, Germ. Weihunohtea
(Christmas), Fostucrht (Lent), are all survivals of the same custom.
cp. also Caes. B. G. VI. 18, 2, 01 the Gauls, spatio omnis temporis
